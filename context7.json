    "Import Sablier contracts from @sablier/lockup, @sablier/flow, or @sablier/airdrops packages",
    "Use PRB Math's UD60x18 for fixed-point arithmetic when working with rates and percentages",
    "Prefer createWithDurations functions over createWithTimestamps for better UX unless timestamps are explicitly required",
    "Always approve token spending before creating streams using IERC20.approve()",
    "Stream IDs are returned as uint256 from all create functions - store these for stream management",
    "For batch operations, use SablierBatchLockup contract",
    "Query stream data via GraphQL indexers (Envio or The Graph) for better performance over direct contract calls",
    "All streams are ERC-721 NFTs - use standard NFT transfer functions for ownership changes",
    "When documenting contract addresses, reference the deployment pages",
    "When Merkle airdrops create Lockup streams during claimed, document the connection between protocols",
    "Hooks enable extensibility - implement ISablierLockupRecipient or ISablierLockupSender for custom logic"
