Let's review each parameter in detail.

### Sender

The address streaming the tokens, with the ability to cancel the stream:

```solidity
params.sender = msg.sender;
```

### Recipient

The address receiving the tokens:

```solidity
params.recipient = address(0xCAFE);
```

### Deposit amount

The deposit amount of ERC-20 tokens to be paid, denoted in units of the token's decimals.

```solidity
params.depositAmount = depositAmount;
```

### Token

The contract address of the ERC-20 token used for streaming. In this example, we will stream DAI:

```solidity
params.token = DAI;
```

### Cancelable

Boolean that indicates whether the stream will be cancelable or not.

```solidity
params.cancelable = true;
```

### Transferable

Boolean that indicates whether the stream will be transferable or not.

```solidity
params.transferable = true;
