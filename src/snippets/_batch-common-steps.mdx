## Function definition

Define a function called `batchCreateStreams` that takes a parameter `perStreamAmount` and returns an array of ids for
the created streams:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/BatchLLStreamCreator.sol#L18`}
</CodeBlock>

## Batch size

Next, declare a batch size, which is needed to calculate the transfer amount:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/BatchLLStreamCreator.sol#L19-L23`}
</CodeBlock>

## ERC-20 steps

To create a stream, the caller must approve the creator contract to pull the tokens from the calling address's account.
Then, we have to also approve the `Batch` contract to pull the tokens that the creator contract will be in possession of
after they are transferred from the calling address (you):

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/BatchLLStreamCreator.sol#L25-L29`}
</CodeBlock>
