In the code above, the contract addresses are hard-coded for demonstration purposes. However, in production, you
would likely use input parameters to allow flexibility in changing the addresses.

Also, these addresses are deployed on Ethereum Sepolia. If you need to work with a different chain, {props.protocol}
addresses can be obtained from the <Link to={`/guides/${props.protocol.toLowerCase()}/deployments`}>{props.protocol}
Deployments</Link> page.
