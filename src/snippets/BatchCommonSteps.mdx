## Function definition

Define a function called `batchCreateStreams` that takes a parameter `perStreamAmount` and returns an array of ids for
the created streams:

```solidity
function batchCreateStreams(uint128 perStreamAmount) public returns (uint256[] memory streamIds) {
  // ...
}
```

## Batch size

Next, declare a batch size, which is needed to calculate the transfer amount:

```solidity
// Create a batch of two streams
uint256 batchSize = 2;

// Calculate the combined amount of DAI to transfer to this contract
uint256 transferAmount = perStreamAmount * batchSize;
```

## ERC-20 steps

To create a stream, the caller must approve the creator contract to pull the tokens from the calling address's account.
Then, we have to also approve the `Batch` contract to pull the tokens that the creator contract will be in possession of
after they are transferred from the calling address (you):

```solidity
// Transfer the provided amount of DAI tokens to this contract
DAI.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), transferAmount);

// Approve the Batch contract to spend DAI
DAI.approve(address(BATCH_LOCKUP), transferAmount);
```
