In this guide, we will go through the steps to set up a local development environment for building onchain integrations
with {props.protocol}. We will use Foundry to install {props.protocol} as a dependency.

At the end, you’ll have a development environment set up that you can use to build the rest of the examples under
"Guides", or start your own integration project.

## Pre-requisites

You will need the following software on your machine:

- <Link href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</Link>
- <Link href="https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry">Foundry</Link>
- <Link href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</Link>
- <Link href="https://bun.sh">Bun</Link>

In addition, familiarity with <Link href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</Link> and

<Link href="https://soliditylang.org/">Solidity</Link> is requisite.

## Set up using Foundry template

:::tip

Make sure you are using the latest version of Foundry by running `foundryup`.

:::

Foundry is a popular development toolkit for Ethereum projects, which we have used to build the {props.protocol}
Protocol. For the purposes of this guide, Foundry will provide us with the tooling needed to compile and test our
contracts.

Let's use this command to spin up a new Foundry project:

```bash
$ forge init my-project
$ cd my-project
```

Once the initialization completes, take a look around at what got set up:

```bash
├── foundry.toml
├── script
├── src
└── test
```

The folder structure should be intuitive:

- `src` is where you'll write Solidity contracts
- `test` is where you'll write tests (also in Solidity)
- `script` is where you'll write scripts to perform actions like deploying contracts (you guessed it, in Solidity)
- `foundry.toml` is where you can configure your Foundry settings, which we will leave as is in this guide

:::note

You might notice that the CLI is `forge` rather than `foundry`. This is because Foundry is a toolkit, and `forge` is
just one of the tools that comes with it.

:::

## Install via npm package

Let's install the {props.protocol} Node.js packages using Bun:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`$ bun add @sablier/${props.protocol.toLowerCase()}`}</CodeBlock>

Bun will download the {props.protocol} contracts, along with their dependencies, and put them in the `node_modules`
directory.

That's it! You should now have a functional development environment to start building onchain {props.protocol}
integrations.

## Next steps

Congratulations! Your environment is now configured, and you are prepared to start building. Explore the guides section
to discover various features available for {props.protocol} integration. Remember to include all contracts (`.sol`
files) in the `src` folder and their corresponding tests in the `test` folder.

As far as Foundry is concerned, there is much more to uncover. If you want to learn more about it, check out the

<Link href="https://book.getfoundry.sh/">Foundry Book</Link>, which contains numerous examples and tutorials. A deep
understanding of Foundry will enable you to create more sophisticated integrations with {props.protocol} protocol.
