## ERC-20 steps

To create a stream, the caller must approve the creator contract to pull the tokens from the calling address's account.
Then, we have to approve the Lockup contract to pull the tokens that the creator contract will be in possession of after
they are transferred from the calling address (you):

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupLinearStreamCreator.sol#L19-L23`}
</CodeBlock>

For more guidance on how to approve and transfer ERC-20 tokens, see
[this article](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on the Ethereum website.
