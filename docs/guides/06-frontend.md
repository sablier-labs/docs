Throughout this series, we've been focusing on creating an onchain integration with Sablier protocols. But maybe you're
interested in developing a front-end app. No worries! In this guide, we'll provide some pointers on how to go about it.

## Toolset

There's no one-size-fits-all toolset for building front-end integrations of Sablier but for this guide we'll recommend
the following:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)

## Project setup

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project:

```sh
npx create-next-app my-project
```
