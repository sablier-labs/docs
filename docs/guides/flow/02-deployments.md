# Flow Deployments

This section contains the deployment addresses for the v1.1 release of
[@sablier/flow](https://npmjs.com/package/@sablier/flow/v/1.1.0).

A few noteworthy details about the deployments:

- The addresses are final
- All contracts are non-upgradeable
- The source code is verified on Etherscan across all chains

## Previous Versions

Any updates or additional features will call for a new deployment of the protocol, due to its immutable nature.
