The gas usage of the Flow protocol is not deterministic and varies by user. Calls to third-party contracts, such as
ERC-20 tokens, may use an arbitrary amount of gas. The values in the table below are rough estimations on Ethereum
mainnet - you shouldn't take them for granted. The gas usage may vary depending on the network.

:::note

Please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sablier-labs/benchmarks) to view the code that generates
these benchmarks.

The following gas benchmarks are generated using a 6-decimal token.
