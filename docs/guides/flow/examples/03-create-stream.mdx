# Create a Flow stream

In this guide, we will show you how you can create a Flow stream using Solidity.

It is important to note that A Flow stream has no end date, which means it will continue to accumulate debt even if no
funds are deposited.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Calculate Rate per Second](./02-calculate-rps.mdx) section.

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/flow`, and the `FlowUtilities` library:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { UD21x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD21x18.sol";
import { ISablierFlow } from "@sablier/flow/src/interfaces/ISablierFlow.sol";

import { FlowUtilities } from "./FlowUtilities.sol";
```

Create a contract called `FlowStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `USDC` of type `IERC20` and a constant `FLOW` of
type `ISablierFlow`:

```solidity
contract FlowStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant USDC = IERC20(0xf08A50178dfcDe18524640EA6618a1f965821715);
    ISablierFlow public constant FLOW = ISablierFlow(0x52ab22e769E31564E17D524b683264B65662A014);
}
```

<Deployment protocol="Flow" />

We will declare two functions, based on the amount desired to stream over a period of time.

## Define a function

Define a function to stream a salary of 1000 USDC per month, call it `createStream_1K_PerMonth` which returns the newly
created stream ID:

```solidity
function createStream_1K_PerMonth() external returns (uint256) {
    // ...
}
```

## Input parameters

### Rate Per Second

Use the [`FlowUtilities`](./02-calculate-rps.mdx) library to calculate the rate per second for the desired amount:

```solidity
UD21x18 ratePerSecond = FlowUtilities.ratePerSecondWithDuration({ token: address(USDC), amount: 1000e6, duration: 30 days });
```

### Sender

The address streaming the tokens, with the ability to `pause` the stream:

```solidity
sender = msg.sender
```

### Recipient

The address receiving the tokens:

```solidity
recipient = address(0xCAFE);
```

### Token

The contract address of the ERC-20 token used for streaming. In this example, we will stream `USDC`:

```solidity
token = USDC;
```

### Transferable

Boolean that indicates whether the stream will be transferable or not.

```solidity
transferable = true;
```

### Invoke the create function

With all the parameters, we can call the `create` function on the `FLOW` contract and assign the newly created stream to
`streamId` variable:

```solidity
streamId = FLOW.create({
    sender: msg.sender,
    recipient: address(0xCAFE),
    ratePerSecond: FlowUtilities.ratePerSecondWithDuration({ token: address(USDC), amount: 1000e6, duration: 30 days }),
    token: USDC,
    transferable: true
});
```
