A unique feature of the Sablier Flow contracts is their ability to batch multiple function calls into a single
transaction. This functionality is made possible by the [`Batch`](/reference/flow/contracts/abstracts/abstract.Batch)
contract, which is inherited by `SablierFlow`. By leveraging this capability, you can execute any combination of
functions efficiently within a single transaction
