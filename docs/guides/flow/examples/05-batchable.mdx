A neat feature of Sablier Flow is the ability to batch multiple function calls into a single transaction. This is made
possible by the [`Batch`](/reference/flow/contracts/abstracts/abstract.Batch) contract, which is inherited by
`SablierFlow`. With this, you can efficiently batch multiple function calls in a single transaction.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ud21x18, UD21x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD21x18.sol";
import { ud60x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD60x18.sol";
import { Broker, ISablierFlow } from "@sablier/flow/src/interfaces/ISablierFlow.sol";
```

Create a contract called `FlowBatchable`, and declare a constant `USDC` of type `IERC20` and a constant `FLOW` of type
`ISablierFlow`:

```solidity
contract FlowBatchable {
    IERC20 public constant USDC = IERC20(0xf08A50178dfcDe18524640EA6618a1f965821715);
    ISablierFlow public constant FLOW = ISablierFlow(0x52ab22e769E31564E17D524b683264B65662A014);
}
```

## Create multiple streams

One of the most useful features achieved by `batch` is the ability to create multiple streams in a single transaction.
Let's focus on it in this example.

Define a function that creates multiple streams and returns their respective stream IDs:

```solidity
function createMultiple() external returns (uint256[] memory streamIds) {
    // ...
}
```

### Parameters

We will create two streams with same stream parameters required by the `create` function.

```solidity
address sender = msg.sender;
address firstRecipient = address(0xCAFE);
address secondRecipient = address(0xBEEF);
UD21x18 firstRatePerSecond = ud21x18(0.0001e18);
UD21x18 secondRatePerSecond = ud21x18(0.0002e18);
bool transferable = true;
```

Construct an array of `bytes` of length 2 to be passed into the `batch` function:

```solidity
bytes[] memory calls = new bytes[](2);
calls[0] = abi.encodeCall(FLOW.create, (sender, firstRecipient, firstRatePerSecond, USDC, transferable));
calls[1] = abi.encodeCall(FLOW.create, (sender, secondRecipient, secondRatePerSecond, USDC, transferable));
```

Since we are creating two streams, the function will return an array containing the two generated stream IDs:

```solidity
uint256 nextStreamId = FLOW.nextStreamId();
streamIds = new uint256[](2);
streamIds[0] = nextStreamId;
streamIds[1] = nextStreamId + 1;
```

Execute the `batch`:

```solidity
FLOW.batch(calls);
```

## Homework

Try to implement the following ideas using `batch` function:

- Adjust Rate Per Second and Deposit
- Pause and Withdraw Max
- Void and Withdraw Max
- Multiple Withdraw Max

Below, you will find the full code for it.

## Other ideas

There are plenty of other possibilities as well! Feel free to experiment and come up with combinations that suit your
system. ðŸš€
