This guide explains how to calculate the rate per second when creating a Flow stream. It is the most important step in
setting up a stream since the rate per second is a key parameter in the stream's configuration.

We assume that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) and the
[Flow Overview](/concepts/flow/overview) sections.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

The rate per second is the amount of tokens streamed in one second. It is represented as a fixed-point number with 18
decimals, specifically as a `UD21x18` type from the `PRBMath` library. The underlying native Solidity type associated
with `UD21x18` is `uint128`.

Depending on how you receive payments, you have to calculate the rate per second and scale its value to 18 decimals
format as below:

1. Based on a duration, e.g., 3 months
2. Between two points in time, e.g., January 1, 2025 to April, 1 2025

The calculation method is the same in either case.

## Set up a library

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the library:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols:

```solidity
import { IERC20Metadata } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol";
import { ud21x18, UD21x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD21x18.sol";
```

Declare a library that can be used in other contracts:

```solidity
library FlowUtilities {}
```

## Calculate the rate per second on a duration

Define a function called `ratePerSecondWithDuration` that takes the following parameters and the returned value:

```solidity
function ratePerSecondWithDuration(
    address token,
    uint128 amount,
    uint40 duration
)
    internal
    view
    returns (UD21x18 ratePerSecond)
{
    // ...
}
```

First, retrieve the token's decimals. Note that not all ERC-20 tokens use the 18-decimal standard.

```solidity
uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(token).decimals();
```

If the token uses 18 decimals, simply divide the amount by the duration:

```solidity
if (decimals == 18) {
    return ud21x18(amount / duration);
}
```

If the token has less than 18 decimals, calculate the scale factor from the token's decimals:

```solidity
uint128 scaleFactor = uint128(10 ** (18 - decimals));
```

Then, multiply the amount by the scale factor and divide it by the duration:

```solidity
return ud21x18((amount * scaleFactor) / duration);
```

## Calculate the rate per second on timestamps

Here, there are two time parameters, a start and an end time, instead of a duration. Let's define the function:

```solidity
function ratePerSecondForTimestamps(
    address token,
    uint128 amount,
    uint40 start,
    uint40 end
)
    internal
    view
    returns (UD21x18 ratePerSecond)
{
    // ...
}
```

The first step is to calculate the duration between the two timestamps:

```solidity
uint40 duration = end - start;
```

The remaining logic is identical to the duration-based calculation:

```solidity
uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(token).decimals();

if (decimals == 18) {
    return ud21x18(amount / duration);
}

uint128 scaleFactor = uint128(10 ** (18 - decimals));

ratePerSecond = ud21x18((scaleFactor * amount) / duration);
```

## Additional utilities

To calculate earnings for specific durations from an existing stream, you can use the following functions:

```solidity
function calculateAmountStreamedPerWeek(UD21x18 ratePerSecond) internal pure returns (uint128 amountPerWeek) {
    amountPerWeek = ratePerSecond.unwrap() * 1 weeks;
}

function calculateAmountStreamedPerMonth(UD21x18 ratePerSecond) internal pure returns (uint128 amountPerMonth) {
    amountPerMonth = ratePerSecond.unwrap() * 30 days;
}

function calculateAmountStreamedPerYear(UD21x18 ratePerSecond) internal pure returns (uint128 amountPerYear) {
    amountPerYear = ratePerSecond.unwrap() * 365 days;
}
```
