# Create a Lockup Tranched Stream

Lockup Tranched are streams with discrete unlocks. In this guide, we will show you how to create a Lockup Tranched
stream using Solidity.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) section.

<CautionNonProduction />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L1-L2`}
</CodeBlock>

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/lockup`:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L4-L7`}
</CodeBlock>

Create a contract called `LockupTranchedStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and a constant
`LOCKUP` of type `ISablierLockup`:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L13-L15`}
</CodeBlock>

<HardcodedDemonstration protocol="Lockup" />

There are two create functions in the Lockup contract that can be used to create Tranched streams:

- `createWithDurationsLT`: takes duration and calculates the tranche timestamps based on the provided durations.
- `createWithTimestampsLT`: takes UNIX timestamps for tranches.

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurationsLT`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createStream` which takes two parameters, `amount0` and `amount1`, and which returns the id of
the created stream:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L18`}
</CodeBlock>

Next, sum up the `amount0` and `amount1` parameters to get the deposit amount of the stream, which will be needed in
many of the steps below:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L20`}
</CodeBlock>

<TokenApproval />

## Parameters

The struct associated with
[`createWithDurationsLT`](/reference/lockup/contracts/interfaces/interface.ISablierLockupTranched#createwithdurationslt)
are [`Lockup.CreateWithDurations`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.Lockup#createwithdurations) (a shared
struct across all the lockup streams) and
[`LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupTranched#tranchewithduration).

Let's review each parameter in detail.

### Create With Durations

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L29`}
</CodeBlock>

<LockupParam />

### Tranches With Duration

Tranches are what the protocol uses to compose the discrete unlocks. For a full exposition of tranches, see the
[Tranches](/concepts/lockup/tranches) guide.

Each tranche is characterized by a specific amount and timestamp. Because we are using `createWithDurationsLT` in this
example, these tranches are supplied to the function in the form of an array containing
[`LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupTranched#tranchewithduration)
structs.

Let's define two dummy tranches:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L40-L42`}
</CodeBlock>

In this example, the first tranche (`amount0`) will unlock at the end of the 4 weeks after the stream was created and
the second tranche (`amount1`) will unlock after further 6 weeks. Thus, the deposit amount will be unlocked in 10 weeks.

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurationsLT` function, and assign the ID of the newly created
stream to a variable:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/LockupTranchedStreamCreator.sol#L45`}
</CodeBlock>
