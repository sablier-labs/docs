# Create a Lockup Dynamic Stream

Dynamic streams are streams with a custom streaming function. In this guide, we will show you how to create a Lockup
Dynamic stream using Solidity.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) section.

<CautionNonProduction />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/lockup`:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ud2x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD2x18.sol";
import { ISablierLockup } from "@sablier/lockup/src/interfaces/ISablierLockup.sol";
import { Lockup, LockupDynamic } from "@sablier/lockup/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupDynamicStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and a constant
`LOCKUP` of type `ISablierLockup`:

```solidity
contract LockupDynamicStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x68194a729C2450ad26072b3D33ADaCbcef39D574);
    ISablierLockup public constant LOCKUP = ISablierLockup(0xcF8ce57fa442ba50aCbC57147a62aD03873FfA73);
}
```

<HardcodedDemonstration protocol="Lockup" />

There are two create functions in the Lockup contract that can be used to create Dynamic streams:

- `createWithDurationsLD`: takes duration and calculates the segment timestamps based on the provided durations.
- `createWithTimestampsLD`: takes UNIX timestamps for segment.

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithTimestampsLD`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createStream` which takes two parameters, `amount0` and `amount1`, and which returns the id of
the created stream:

```solidity
function createStream(uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

Next, sum up the `amount0` and `amount1` parameters to get the deposit amount of the stream, which will be needed in
many of the steps below:

```solidity
uint128 depositAmount = amount0 + amount1;
```

<TokenApproval />

## Parameters

The struct associated with `createWithTimestampsLD` are
[`Lockup.CreateWithTimestamps`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.Lockup#createwithtimestamps) (a shared struct
across all the lockup streams) and
[`LockupDynamic.Segment`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupDynamic#segment).

```solidity
LockupDynamic.CreateWithTimestamps memory params;
LockupDynamic.Segment[] memory segments = new LockupDynamic.Segment[](2);
```

<LockupParam />

### Start Time and End Time

The start and end timestamps for the stream. Note that the end timestamps much match the timestamp of the last segment.

```solidity
params.timestamps.start = uint40(block.timestamp + 100 seconds);
params.timestamps.end = uint40(block.timestamp + 52 weeks);
```

### Segments

Segments are what the protocol uses to compose the custom distribution curve of a Dynamic stream. For a full exposition
of segments, see the [Segments](/concepts/lockup/segments) guide.

The term "segment" refers to the splitting of the stream into separate partitions, with each segment characterized by a
specific amount, exponent, and timestamp. These segments are supplied to the function in the form of an array containing
[`LockupDynamic.Segment`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupDynamic#segment) structs.

Let's define two dummy segments:

```solidity
segments[0] = LockupDynamic.Segment({
    amount: amount0,
    exponent: ud2x18(1e18),
    timestamp: uint40(block.timestamp + 4 weeks)
});
segments[1] = (
    LockupDynamic.Segment({
        amount: amount1,
        exponent: ud2x18(3.14e18),
        timestamp: uint40(block.timestamp + 52 weeks)
    })
);
```

In this example, the first segment (`amount0`) will stream much faster than the second segment (`amount1`), because the
exponents are different. As a rule of thumb: the higher the exponent, the slower the stream.

:::note

The segment timestamp must be in ascending order.

:::

:::info

The `ud2x18` function wraps a basic integer to the `UD2x18` value type, which is part of the
[PRBMath](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math) library.

:::

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithTimestampsLD` function, and assign the id of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = LOCKUP.createWithTimestampsLD(params, segments);
```
