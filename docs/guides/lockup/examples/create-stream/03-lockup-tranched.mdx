# Create a Lockup Tranched Stream

Lockup Tranched are streams with discrete unlocks. In this guide, we will show you how to create a Lockup Tranched
stream using Solidity.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) section.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/lockup`:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ud60x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD60x18.sol";
import { ISablierLockup } from "@sablier/lockup/src/interfaces/ISablierLockup.sol";
import { Broker, Lockup, LockupTranched } from "@sablier/lockup/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupTranchedStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and a constant
`LOCKUP` of type `ISablierLockup`:

```solidity
contract LockupTranchedStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x68194a729C2450ad26072b3D33ADaCbcef39D574);
    ISablierLockup public constant LOCKUP = ISablierLockup(0xC2Da366fD67423b500cDF4712BdB41d0995b0794);
}
```

<Deployment protocol="Lockup" />

There are two create functions in the Lockup contract that can be used to create Tranched streams:

- `createWithDurationsLT`: takes duration and calculates the tranche timestamps based on the provided durations.
- `createWithTimestampsLT`: takes UNIX timestamps for tranches.

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurationsLT`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createStream` which takes two parameters, `amount0` and `amount1`, and which returns the id of
the created stream:

```solidity
function createStream(uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

Next, sum up the `amount0` and `amount1` parameters to get the total amount of the stream, which will be needed in many
of the steps below:

```solidity
uint256 totalAmount = amount0 + amount1;
```

## Parameters

The struct associated with `createWithDurationsLT` are
[`Lockup.CreateWithDurations`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.Lockup#createwithdurations) (a shared struct
across all the lockup streams) and
[`LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupTranched#tranchewithduration).

```solidity
Lockup.CreateWithDurations memory params;
LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration[] memory tranches = new LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration[](2);
```

Let's review each parameter in detail.

<LockupParam />

### Tranches With Duration

Tranches are what the protocol uses to compose the discrete unlocks. For a full exposition of tranches, see the
[Tranches](/concepts/lockup/tranches) guide.

Each tranche is characterized by a specific amount and timestamp. Because we are using `createWithDurationsLT` in this
example, these tranches are supplied to the function in the form of an array containing
[`LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupTranched#tranchewithduration)
structs.

Let's define two dummy tranches:

```solidity
params.tranches[0] = LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration({
    amount: amount0,
    duration: uint40(4 weeks)
});
params.tranches[1] = (
    LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration({
        amount: amount1,
        duration: uint40(6 weeks)
    })
);
```

In this example, the first tranche (`amount0`) will unlock at the end of the 4 weeks after the stream was created and
the second tranche (`amount1`) will unlock after further 6 weeks. Thus, the total amount will be unlocked in 10 weeks.

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurationsLT` function, and assign the ID of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = LOCKUP.createWithDurationsLT(params, tranches);
```
