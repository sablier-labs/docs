# Create a Lockup Linear Stream

Linear streams are streams with a linear streaming function. In this guide, we will show you how to create a Lockup
Linear stream using Solidity.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) section.

<CautionNonProduction />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/lockup`:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ISablierLockup } from "@sablier/lockup/src/interfaces/ISablierLockup.sol";
import { Lockup, LockupLinear } from "@sablier/lockup/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupLinearStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and a constant
`LOCKUP` of type `ISablierLockup`:

```solidity
contract LockupLinearStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F);
    ISablierLockup public constant LOCKUP = ISablierLockup(0xcF8ce57fa442ba50aCbC57147a62aD03873FfA73);
}
```

<HardcodedDemonstration protocol="Lockup" />

There are two create functions in the Lockup contract that can be used to create Linear streams:

- `createWithDurationsLL`: takes duration and calculates the start and end timestamps based on the provided durations.
- `createWithTimestampsLL`: takes start and end timestamps.

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurationsLL`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createStream` which takes a single parameter `depositAmount`, and which returns the id of the
created stream:

```solidity
function createStream(uint128 depositAmount) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

<TokenApproval />

## Parameters

The struct associated with `createWithDurationsLL` are
[`Lockup.CreateWithDurations`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.Lockup#createwithdurations) (a shared struct
across all the lockup streams),
[`LockupLinear.Durations`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupLinear#durations) and
[`LockupLinear.UnlockAmounts`](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.LockupLinear#unlockamounts).

```solidity
Lockup.CreateWithDurations memory params;
LockupLinear.UnlockAmounts memory unlockAmounts;
LockupLinear.Durations memory durations;
```

<LockupParam />

### Unlock Amounts

Struct containing details on unlock amounts at start time and at cliff time.

```solidity
unlockAmounts = LockupLinear.UnlockAmounts({ start: 0, cliff: 0 });
```

### Durations

Struct containing (i) cliff duration and (ii) total stream duration, both denoted in seconds.

```solidity
durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 0,
    total: 52 weeks
});
```

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurationsLL` function, and assign the id of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = LOCKUP.createWithDurationsLL(params, unlockAmounts, durations);
```
