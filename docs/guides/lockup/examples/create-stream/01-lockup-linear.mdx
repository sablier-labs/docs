# Create a Lockup Linear stream

Lockup Linear are streams with a strictly linear streaming function. In this guide, we will show you how to
programmatically create a Lockup Linear stream.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) section.

:::note

This guide interacts with the Core contracts directly.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/v2-core`:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ud60x18 } from "@prb/math/src/UD60x18.sol";
import { ISablierV2LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupLinear.sol";
import { Broker, LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupLinearStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and a constant
`LOCKUP_LINEAR` of type `ISablierV2LockupLinear`:

```solidity
contract LockupLinearStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x68194a729C2450ad26072b3D33ADaCbcef39D574);
    ISablierV2LockupLinear public constant LOCKUP_LINEAR =
        ISablierV2LockupLinear(0x3E435560fd0a03ddF70694b35b673C25c65aBB6C);
}
```

<ConstantsComment />

<CreateFunctions />

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurations`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createStream` which takes a single parameter `totalAmount`, and which returns the id of the
created stream:

```solidity
function createStream(uint128 totalAmount) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

## ERC-20 steps

To create a stream, the caller must approve the creator contract to pull the tokens from the calling address's account.
Then, we have to also approve the Lockup linear contract to pull the assets that the creator contract will be in
possession of after they are transferred from the calling address (you):

```solidity
// Transfer the provided amount of DAI tokens to this contract
DAI.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);

// Approve the Lockup linear contract to spend DAI
DAI.approve(address(LOCKUP_LINEAR), totalAmount);
```

For more guidance on how to approve and transfer ERC-20 tokens, see
[this article](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on the Ethereum website.

## Parameters

Lockup linear uses structs to encode the parameters of its create functions. The struct associated with
`createWithDurations` is
[`LockupLinear.CreateWithDurations`](/reference/lockup/core/types/library.LockupLinear#createwithdurations), and it can
be initialized like this:

```solidity
LockupLinear.CreateWithDurations memory params;
```

Let's review each parameter in detail.

<ParamSender />

<ParamRecipient />

<ParamTotalAmount />

<ParamAsset />

<ParamCancelable />

<ParamTransferable />

### Durations

Struct containing (i) cliff period duration and (ii) total stream duration, both in seconds.

```solidity
params.durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 4 weeks,
    total: 52 weeks
});
```

<ParamBroker />

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurations` function, and assign the id of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = LOCKUP_LINEAR.createWithDurations(params);
```

## The complete Lockup Linear stream creator contract

Below you can see the complete functioning code: a contract that creates Lockup Linear streams that start at
`block.timestamp`. You can access the code on GitHub through
[this link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/lockup/core/LockupLinearStreamCreator.sol).
