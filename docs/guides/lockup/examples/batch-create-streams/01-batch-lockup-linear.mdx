# Create a Batch of Linear Streams

In this guide, we will show you how you can use Solidity to batch create linear streams via the
[Batch Lockup](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.SablierBatchLockup) contract.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/streaming) section.

<CautionNonProduction />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Now, import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/lockup`:

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import { ISablierLockup } from "@sablier/lockup/src/interfaces/ISablierLockup.sol";
import { LockupLinear } from "@sablier/lockup/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
import { ISablierBatchLockup } from "@sablier/lockup/src/interfaces/ISablierBatchLockup.sol";
import { BatchLockup } from "@sablier/lockup/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
```

Create a contract called `BatchLLStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20`, a constant `LOCKUP` of
type `ISablierLockup`, and a constant `BATCH_LOCKUP` of type `ISablierBatchLockup`:

```solidity
contract BatchLLStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x68194a729C2450ad26072b3D33ADaCbcef39D574);
    ISablierLockup public constant LOCKUP = ISablierLockup(0xcF8ce57fa442ba50aCbC57147a62aD03873FfA73);
    ISablierBatchLockup public constant BATCH_LOCKUP = ISablierBatchLockup(0x0636D83B184D65C242c43de6AAd10535BFb9D45a);
}
```

## Batch create functions

There are two batch create functions for the Linear streams:

- [`createWithDurationsLL`](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.SablierBatchLockup#createwithdurationsll)
- [`createWithTimestampsLL`](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.SablierBatchLockup#createwithtimestampsll)

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurationsLL`.

<BatchCommonSteps />

## Stream Parameters

Given that we declared a `batchSize` of two, we need to define two
[BatchLockup.CreateWithDurationsLL](/reference/lockup/contracts/types/library.BatchLockup#createwithdurationsll)
structs:

```solidity
BatchLockup.CreateWithDurationsLL memory stream0;
stream0.sender = address(0xABCD); // The sender to stream the tokens, he will be able to cancel the stream
stream0.recipient = address(0xCAFE); // The recipient of the streamed tokens
stream0.depositAmount = perStreamAmount; // The deposit amount of each stream
stream0.cancelable = true; // Whether the stream will be cancelable or not
stream0.transferable = false; // Whether the recipient can transfer the NFT or not
stream0.durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 4 weeks, // Tokens will start streaming continuously after 4 weeks
    total: 52 weeks // Setting a total duration of ~1 year
});
stream0.unlockAmounts = LockupLinear.UnlockAmounts({
    start: 0, // Whether the stream will unlock a certain amount of tokens at the start time
    cliff: 0 // Whether the stream will unlock a certain amount of tokens at the cliff time
});
```

To add some variety, we will change the parameters of the second stream:

```solidity
BatchLockup.CreateWithDurationsLL memory stream1;
stream1.sender = address(0xABCD); // The sender to stream the tokens, he will be able to cancel the stream
stream1.recipient = address(0xBEEF); // The recipient of the streamed tokens
stream1.depositAmount = perStreamAmount; // The deposit amount of each stream
stream1.cancelable = false; // Whether the stream will be cancelable or not
stream1.transferable = false; // Whether the recipient can transfer the NFT or not
stream1.durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 1 weeks, // Tokens will start streaming continuously after 4 weeks
    total: 26 weeks // Setting a total duration of ~6 months
});
stream1.unlockAmounts = LockupLinear.UnlockAmounts({
    start: 0, // Whether the stream will unlock a certain amount of tokens at the start time
    cliff: 0 // Whether the stream will unlock a certain amount of tokens at the start time
});
```

Once both structs are declared, the batch array has to be filled:

```solidity
// Fill the batch param
BatchLockup.CreateWithDurationsLL[] memory batch = new BatchLockup.CreateWithDurationsLL[](batchSize);
batch[0] = stream0;
batch[1] = stream1;
```

## Invoke the batch create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurationsLL` function, and assign the ids of the newly created
streams to the array:

```solidity
streamIds = BATCH_LOCKUP.createWithDurationsLL(LOCKUP_LINEAR, DAI, batch);
```
