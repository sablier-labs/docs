This section assumes that you have already gone through the [setup](/guides/lockup/examples/stream-management/setup)
part.

See the [Access Control](/reference/lockup/access-control) guide for an overview of who is allowed to cancel streams.

:::

Canceling streams involves stopping the flow of tokens before the stream's end time and refunding the remaining funds to
the sender. However, the portion that has already been streamed is <ins>NOT</ins> automatically transferred - the
recipient will need to withdraw it.

There are two functions that can be used to cancel streams:

1. [`cancel`](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.SablierLockup#cancel): cancels a single stream
2. [`cancelMultiple`](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.SablierLockup#cancelmultiple): cancels multiple streams at
   once

To call any of these functions, you need to have created a cancelable stream. If you don't have one yet, go back to the
[previous guide](/guides/lockup/examples/create-stream/lockup-linear) and create a stream. Then, you can use the
`cancel` function like this:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/StreamManagement.sol#L51-L53`}
</CodeBlock>

In addition to the `cancel` function, there is the `cancelMultiple` function, which allows you to cancel several streams
at once:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" metastring={`reference title=""`}>
  {`https://github.com/sablier-labs/evm-examples/blob/main/lockup/StreamManagement.sol#L56-L58`}
</CodeBlock>
