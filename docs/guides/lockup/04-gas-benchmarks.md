The gas usage of the Lockup protocol is not deterministic and varies by user. Calls to third-party contracts, such as
ERC-20 tokens, may use an arbitrary amount of gas. The values in the table below are rough estimations on Ethereum
mainnet - you shouldn't take them for granted. The gas usage may vary depending on the network.

these benchmarks.
