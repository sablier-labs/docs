# Lockup Protocol

Welcome to the Lockup Protocol documentation.

This section contains detailed guides and technical references for the Lockup Protocol, a suite of smart contracts
running autonomously in the Ethereum ecosystem. These documents offer insight into the operational nuances of the
contracts, providing a valuable resource for building onchain integrations.

# Guides

If you are new to Sablier, we recommend you start with the [Concepts](/concepts/what-is-sablier) section first.

You can then setup your [local environment](/guides/lockup/examples/local-environment) and create your
[first stream](/guides/lockup/examples/create-stream/lockup-linear).

# Reference

For a deeper dive into the protocol specifications, read through the [technical reference](/reference/lockup/diagrams).
