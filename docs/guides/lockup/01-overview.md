# Sablier Lockup

Welcome to the Sablier Lockup protocol documentation.

This section contains detailed guides and technical references for the Lockup protocol, a suite of smart contracts
running autonomously in the Ethereum ecosystem. These documents offer insight into the operational nuances of the
contracts, providing a valuable resource for building onchain integrations.

# Guides

If you are new to Sablier, we recommend you start with the [Concepts](/concepts/what-is-sablier) section first.

You can then setup your [local environment](/guides/lockup/examples/local-environment) and create your
[first stream](/guides/lockup/examples/create-stream/lockup-linear).

# Reference

For a deeper dive into the protocol specifications, read through the [technical reference](/reference/lockup/diagrams).

# Versioning

The product uses a unified versioning system across releases and npm packages. Prior to v1.2, lockup releases followed a
separate versioning scheme (e.g. V2.0, V2.1, V2.2), while the npm package used a semantic versioning scheme (e.g.
v1.0.2, v1.1.2, v1.2.0). Since v1.2, the versioning has been standardized to a single system for consistency across
protocol releases and npm packages.
