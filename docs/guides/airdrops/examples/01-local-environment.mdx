## Pre-requisites

<Prerequisite />

## Set up using Foundry template

:::tip

Make sure you are using the latest version of Foundry by running `foundryup`.

:::

<SetupWithFoundry protocol="Airdrops" />

:::note

You might notice that the CLI is `forge` rather than `foundry`. This is because Foundry is a toolkit, and `forge` is
just one of the tools that comes with it.

:::

## Install Merkle Airdrops npm packages

:::tip

If you are integrating with `MerkleLL` or `MerkleLT`, you will also have to install
[Lockup npm package](/guides/lockup/examples/local-environment#install-lockup-npm-packages). Both `MerkleLL` and
`MerkleLT` contracts interact with Lockup protocol to setup up vesting for airdropped tokens.
