:::info[Reach Out]

We are unable to deploy the Sablier Protocol on every EVM chain. However, we would be happy to consider your project if
you fill out this <Link href={links.forms.chains}>form</Link> and meet the requirements below.

:::

## Requirements

- Blockchain explorer with instructions for verifying contracts
- Documentation site
- Bridge, with instructions for how to obtain the native token (e.g., ETH) and ERC-20 tokens to the target chain
- GraphQL solution, e.g., a deployment of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)
- Functional JSON-RPC endpoint, ideally listed on [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/)

## Lockup Deployment Guide

The following guidelines apply to you only if you have you been granted a
[BUSL license](https://app.ens.domains/lockup-license-grants.sablier.eth?tab=records) to deploy the Lockup Protocol.

### Prerequisites

- Check if the deployment is not already made on [your chain](/guides/lockup/deployments)
- Follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- RPC endpoint, e.g., a paid Infura account
- Enough ETH in your deployer account
- Etherscan API key (for source code verification)

### Steps for deploying Core contracts

#### Step 1: Clone the [Lockup core repo](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core) and checkout to the latest release tag

At the time of writing, the latest release tag is `v1.2.0`:

```bash
git checkout v1.2.0
```

#### Step 2: Create an `.env` file

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following variables to `.env` file:

```
EOA="DEPLOYER ADDRESS"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="EXPLORER API KEY"
PRIVATE_KEY="PRIVATE KEY OF DEPLOYER ADDRESS"
RPC_URL="RPC ENDPOINT URL"
VERIFIER_URL="EXPLORER VERIFICATION URL"
```

Load the environment variables into your shell:

```bash
source .env
```

#### Step 3: Run the following deployment command

:::warning[Important]

You must set the protocol admin to the Sablier controlled address 0xD427d37B5F6d33f7D42C4125979361E011FFbfD9. Failure to
do so will result in your deployment not being acknowledged as official.

:::

For **deterministic** deployment:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized \
forge script script/DeployDeterministicCore.s.sol \
--broadcast \
--etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--sig "run(address)" 0xD427d37B5F6d33f7D42C4125979361E011FFbfD9 \
--verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL \
--verify \
-vvv
```

For **non-deterministic** deployment:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized \
forge script script/DeployCore.s.sol \
--broadcast \
--etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL \
--sig "run(address)" 0xD427d37B5F6d33f7D42C4125979361E011FFbfD9 \
--verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL \
--verify \
-vvv
```

If you are using a mnemonic or a hardware device for your deployer address, refer to `forge-script` page from
[foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script#forge-script) for different wallet options.

### Steps for deploying Periphery contracts

#### Step 1: Clone the [Lockup periphery repo](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery) and checkout to the latest release tag

At the time of writing, the latest release tag is `v1.2.0`:

```bash
git checkout v1.2.0
```

#### Step 2: Create an `.env` file

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following variables to `.env` file:

```
EOA="DEPLOYER ADDRESS"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="EXPLORER API KEY"
PRIVATE_KEY="PRIVATE KEY OF DEPLOYER ADDRESS"
RPC_URL="RPC ENDPOINT URL"
VERIFIER_URL="EXPLORER VERIFICATION URL"
```

Load the environment variables into shell:

```bash
source .env
```

#### Step 3: Run the following command to deploy all periphery contracts

For **deterministic** deployments, meaning that CREATE2 is used:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized \
forge script script/DeployDeterministicPeriphery.s.sol \
--broadcast \
--etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL \
--sig "run()" \
--verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL \
--verify \
-vvv
```

For **non-deterministic** deployments:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized \
forge script script/DeployPeriphery.s.sol \
--broadcast \
--etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL \
--sig "run()" \
--verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL \
--verify \
-vvv
```

If you are using a mnemonic or a hardware device for your deployer address, refer to `forge-script` page from the
[Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script#forge-script).

### Steps for adding the deployments

Once the contracts are deployed, the final step is to add the deployment addresses and broadcast files in the Sablier
docs:

1. Add the deployment addresses by opening a PR in the
   [docs repo](https://github.com/sablier-labs/docs/blob/main/docs/guides/lockup/02-deployments.md).
2. Copy the latest broadcast files (JSON) from your project's `broadcast` directory, and proceed with opening the PR in
   the [deployments repo](https://github.com/sablier-labs/deployments).
