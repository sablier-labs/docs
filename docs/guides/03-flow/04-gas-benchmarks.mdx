The gas usage of the Flow protocol is not deterministic and varies by user. Calls to third-party contracts, such as
ERC-20 tokens, may use an arbitrary amount of gas. The values in the table below are rough estimations on Ethereum
mainnet - you shouldn't take them for granted. The gas usage may vary depending on the network.

The benchmarks were generated using the code in this <Link href={Links.GitHub.BENCHMARKS}>GitHub repository</Link>.
