Ensuring the security of the Sablier Protocol is our utmost priority. We have dedicated significant efforts towards the
design and testing of the protocol to guarantee its safety and reliability.

## Audits

The codebase has undergone rigorous audits by leading security experts from [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/),
[CodeHawks](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/), and many independent auditors. For a comprehensive list of all audits
conducted, check out [this link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/audits).

## Bug Bounty

The Sablier Protocol is subject to a bug bounty program per the terms outlined
