This contract implements the ERC-3156 standard to enable flash loans.

_See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156._

## State Variables

### CALLBACK_SUCCESS

```solidity
bytes32 internal constant CALLBACK_SUCCESS = keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
```

## Functions

### flashFee

The amount of fees to charge for a hypothetical flash loan amount.

You might notice a bit of a terminology clash here, since the ERC-3156 standard refers to the "flash fee" as an amount,
whereas the flash fee retrieved from the comptroller is a percentage. Throughout the code base, the "amount" suffix is
typically appended to variables that represent amounts, but, in this context, the name must be kept unchanged to comply
with the ERC. Requirements:

- The ERC-20 asset must be flash loanable.

```solidity
function flashFee(address asset, uint256 amount) public view override returns (uint256 fee);
```

**Parameters**

| Name     | Type      | Description                         |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `asset`  | `address` | The ERC-20 asset to flash loan.     |
| `amount` | `uint256` | The amount of `asset` flash loaned. |

**Returns**

| Name  | Type      | Description                                                                    |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fee` | `uint256` | The amount of `asset` to charge for the loan on top of the returned principal. |

### maxFlashLoan

The amount of ERC-20 assets available for flash loan.

_If the ERC-20 asset is not flash loanable, this function returns zero._

```solidity
function maxFlashLoan(address asset) external view override returns (uint256 amount);
```

**Parameters**

| Name    | Type      | Description                               |
| ------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `asset` | `address` | The address of the ERC-20 asset to query. |

**Returns**

| Name     | Type      | Description                                     |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `amount` | `uint256` | The amount of `asset` that can be flash loaned. |

### flashLoan

Allows smart contracts to access the entire liquidity of the Sablier V2 contract within one transaction as long as the
principal plus a flash fee is returned.

Emits a {FlashLoan} event. Requirements:

- Must not be delegate called.
- Refer to the requirements in {flashFee}.
- `amount` must be less than 2^128.
- `fee` must be less than 2^128.
- `amount` must not exceed the liquidity available for `asset`.
- `msg.sender` must allow this contract to spend at least `amount + fee` assets.
- `receiver` implementation of {IERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan} must return `CALLBACK_SUCCESS`.

```solidity
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
)
    external
    override
    noDelegateCall
    returns (bool success);
```

**Parameters**

| Name       | Type                    | Description                                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `receiver` | `IERC3156FlashBorrower` | The receiver of the flash loaned assets, and the receiver of the callback. |
| `asset`    | `address`               | The address of the ERC-20 asset to use for flash borrowing.                |
| `amount`   | `uint256`               | The amount of `asset` to flash loan.                                       |
| `data`     | `bytes`                 | Arbitrary data structure, intended to contain user-defined parameters.     |

**Returns**

| Name      | Type   | Description        |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| `success` | `bool` | `true` on success. |

## Events

### FlashLoan

Emitted when a flash loan is executed.

```solidity
event FlashLoan(
    address indexed initiator,
    IERC3156FlashBorrower indexed receiver,
    IERC20 indexed asset,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 feeAmount,
    bytes data
);
```
