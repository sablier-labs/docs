## Storage layout

Each Lockup contract is a singleton that stores all streams created by all users. The following diagrams will give you
an idea of how the storage layout looks like.

:::note

To see the full list of storage variables: [click here](/contracts/v2/reference/core/types/library.Lockup#stream). The
common stream struct is shared across LockupLinear, LockcupDynamic and LockupTranched.
