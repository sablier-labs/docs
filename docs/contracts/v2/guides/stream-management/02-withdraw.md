This section assumes that you have already gone through the [setup](/contracts/v2/guides/stream-management/setup) part.

See the [Access Control](/contracts/v2/reference/access-control) guide for an overview of who is allowed to withdraw
from streams.

:::

Withdrawing from streams means claiming the assets that have become due to the recipient, who has the option to direct
the withdrawal to an alternative address of their choice.

There are four withdrawal functions:

1. `withdraw`: withdraws a specific amount of assets.
2. `withdrawMax`: withdraws the maximum withdrawable amount of assets.
3. `withdrawMultiple`: withdraws specific amounts of assets from multiple streams at once.

To call any of these functions, you need to have created a stream. If you don't have one yet, go back to the
[previous guide](/contracts/v2/guides/create-stream/lockup-linear) and create a stream with a brief duration, assigning
the `StreamManagement` contract as the recipient. Then, you can use the `withdraw` function like this:

```solidity reference title="Stream Management: Withdraw"
https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/StreamManagement.sol#L20-L22
```

In this example, the withdrawal address and withdrawal amount are hard-coded for demonstration purposes. However, in a
production environment, these values would likely be adjustable parameters determined by the user.

In addition to the `withdraw` function, there is the `withdrawMax` function, which you can use to withdraw the maximum
withdrawable amount of assets at the time of invocation:

```solidity reference title="Stream Management: Withdraw Max"
https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/StreamManagement.sol#L25-L27
```

What `withdrawMax` does is call the `withdrawableAmountOf` function and pass its result to `withdraw`.

Lastly, there is the `withdrawMultiple` function, with which you can withdraw from multiple streams at once:

```solidity reference title="Stream Management: Withdraw Multiple"
https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/StreamManagement.sol#L30-L32
```
