## Requirements

- Blockchain explorer
- Documentation site
- Bridge, with step-by-step instructions for how to bridge ETH and ERC-20 tokens to the target chain
- GraphQL solution, e.g. a deployment of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)
- Functional JSON-RPC endpoint, ideally listed on [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/)
