# Etherscan: Manual Operations

## Introduction

Just like any other open protocol, Sablier V2 can be interacted with directly through a blockchain explorer like
Etherscan.

In this guide, we will show you how to create a stream and withdraw from a stream by manually interacting with the
Sablier V2 core contracts on Etherscan.

If you're interested in interacting with V1, please refer to this
[article](https://blog.sablier.com/operating-the-sablier-v1-protocol-manually/).

## Creating a Stream

### Prerequisites

Before being able to create a stream using the Sablier V2 Core contracts you need to have granted a sufficient token
allowance. See the [Allowances](#erc20-allowances) section below for a guide on how to do that.

### Step 1: Go to contract page

Head over to our [deployments](/contracts/v2/deployments) list to pick the contract address you want to interact with.
For each chain, that will be either `SablierV2LockupLinear` or `SablierV2LockupDynamic` or `SablierV2LockupTranched`. In
this tutorial, we will create a **LockupLinear** stream on Sepolia.

Once you find the right contract, click on the address to access its explorer's page. Click on the "Contract" tab, and
then on the "Write Contract" sub-tab.

You can now connect your wallet to the interface by clicking on "Connect to Web3".

![Etherscan 03](/img/etherscan-tutorial/03.png)

### Step 2: Fill in parameters

We will now proceed to create our first stream. Let's go with the following parameters:

- a `LockupLinear` stream
- and a deposit of 20,000 DAI
- starting Jan 1, 2024
- ending Jan 1, 2025
- with no cliff
- and non-cancelable

As the start and end date are fixed, we'll be using the `createWithTimestamps` method. Please note, however, that using
`createWithDurations` is possible, too. To learn more about the difference between these two functions, head over
[here](/contracts/v2/reference/core/interfaces/interface.ISablierV2LockupLinear#createwithdurations).

Open the **"createWithTimestamps"** method, and start filling in the stream details:

![Etherscan 04](/img/etherscan-tutorial/04.png)

```json
{
  "sender": "0xe0ae83a6b9cc4f24d0638dc27179f311671e4e2a",
  "recipient": "0xb4bf8a8475d1e8e9a2088f118ad0e2cdc2896183",
  "totalAmount": 20000000000000000000000,
  "asset": "0x97cb342cf2f6ecf48c1285fb8668f5a4237bf862",
  "cancelable": false,
  "transferable": true,
  "range": [1704067200, 1704067200, 1735689600],
  "broker": ["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 0]
}
```

#### Sender

If the stream is cancelable, the `sender` is the wallet that will have the ability to cancel the stream and withdraw on
behalf of the recipient. But if the stream is non-cancelable, the `sender` cannot cancel the stream.

Most users will set their own wallet address as the `sender`.

#### Recipient

The address you want to stream tokens to. The controller of this address will be able to
[withdraw](#withdrawing-from-a-stream) tokens as they become available.

#### Total Amount

The `totalAmount` is the final amount of tokens what will be streamed, **DECIMALS INCLUDED**. If the token you are
looking to stream has 18 decimals, for example, you will need to add eighteen zeros after the amount. Let's say you want
to stream 20,000 DAI like in this example, you will need to fill in `20000000000000000000000`.

:::note

The total amount will also include any [broker fee](/concepts/protocol/fees). While fees are kept at zero (most likely),
the final streamed amount will be equal to this total amount.

:::

#### Asset

The `asset` is the contract address of the ERC-20 token you are looking to stream. You can get this from the
[Sablier Interface](#step-1-go-to-token-page) or from any other wallet/explorer. Please double check the token is
correct before continuing the process.

#### Cancelable

The `cancelable` field indicates whether or not you want the stream to be cancelable. This can be set to either `true`
or `false`. If set to true, the stream will be cancelable.

This flag can be switched off later, but never switched back on.

#### Transferable

The `transferable` field indicates whether the NFT owner is allowed to transfer te NFT or not. THis can be set either to
`true` or `false`. If set to true, the NFT will be transferable.

This flag cannot be changed later.

#### Range

The `range` contains the start, cliff date, and the end time of the stream, respectively. They should be put in as UNIX
timestamps (represented as **seconds**). You can find a Unix timestamp converter [here](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).

If you prefer to not have a cliff, you can simply put the same timestamp for the cliff as the start timestamp of the
stream, like in this example (a.k.a. the duration of the cliff is kept as `0`). If, however, you want to have a cliff,
fill in the end date of the cliff there, as the middle parameter (as a Unix timestamp, of course). Make sure to **not**
leave spaces between the values, including after the commas. Here is how it should look like
`[<start timestamp>,<cliff timestamp>,<end timestamp>]`

| Ranges              | [Start, Cliff, End]                  |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| 1 year, no cliff    | `[1704067200,1704067200,1735689600]` |
| 1 year, 1 day cliff | `[1704067200,1704153600,1735689600]` |

#### Broker

An optional parameter that can be set in order to charge a fee as a percentage of `totalAmount`.

You can set the `broker` field to address zero and `zero` fees. Read more about fees
[here](/concepts/protocol/fees#broker-fees).

:::caution

Inside tuples/arrays (the `[ ... ]` structures in the example) make sure that you:

- don't leave empty spaces after `,` (e.g. `[a,b]` is fine, but `[a, b]` isn't)
- wrap addresses between double quotes, i.e. `" "`

:::

Once the data is filled, and after you double-checked, click on the "Write" button and confirm the transaction in your
wallet. That's all! You are done. You can now head over to the [Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com), connect
your wallet, and your stream should appear like this:

![Etherscan 05](/img/etherscan-tutorial/05.png)

#### How about `createWithDurations`?

For the durations version, we'll replace the `range` parameter with a new one representing the total length of the
stream (in seconds) and the size of the cliff (in seconds).

```json
{
  "durations": [0, 31536000] // no cliff and a total duration of 1 year ~= 365 days
}
```

| Durations            | [Cliff, Total]   |
| :------------------- | :--------------- |
| 10 days, no cliff    | `[0,864000]`     |
| 10 days, 1 day cliff | `[86400,864000]` |

## Withdrawing from a Stream

### Prerequisites

To withdraw from a stream using Etherscan, you will need to obtain the stream's ID. To obtain this without the Sablier
Interface, find the transaction which created the stream on Etherscan. Here's an
[example](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe1beef35643bd40ca17e8bf8ced365fe1cace475dbbf4ce4c41e7f299b741dce) of what it
should look like.

Once found, you will see the stream ID between the two brackets. Note that stream ID and "Token ID" are the same thing.

:::info

Anyone can withdraw on your behalf and they also pay the gas fee. However, the withdraw will only be allowed to your
address. But if you are the recipient, you can choose to withdraw to any other address. You can read more about this
advanced feature [here](/contracts/v2/reference/access-control#overview).

:::

![Etherscan 06](/img/etherscan-tutorial/06.png)

### Step 1: Go to contract page

Head over to our [deployments](/contracts/v2/deployments) list and select the contract address you want to interact
with. For each chain, that will be either `SablierV2LockupLinear` or `SablierV2LockupDynamic`.

Once you find the right contract, click on the address to access its explorer's page. Click on the "Contract" tab, and
then on the "Write Contract" sub-tab.

![Etherscan 01](/img/etherscan-tutorial/01.png)

![Etherscan 02](/img/etherscan-tutorial/02.png)

You can now connect your wallet to the interface by clicking on "Connect to Web3".

![Etherscan 03](/img/etherscan-tutorial/03.png)

### Step 2: Fill in parameters

Head over to the **`withdraw`** method, and fill in the data.

![Etherscan 07](/img/etherscan-tutorial/07.png)

```json
{
  "streamId": 169,
  "to": "0xb4bf8a8475d1e8e9a2088f118ad0e2cdc2896183",
  "amount": 100000000000000000000
}
```

#### Stream ID

The `streamId` is the value you have previously located in the transaction in which the stream was created.

#### To

The `to (address)` field is there for the stream recipient's address. This will most likely be your own wallet, but you
can also choose to withdraw these funds to another wallet (e.g. a separate cold wallet) if you are the stream's
recipient.

#### Amount

This represents the amount of tokens that you want to withdraw, **DECIMALS INCLUDED**. For example, if the token you are
looking to withdraw has 18 decimals, you will need to add eighteen zeros after the amount. Let's say you want to
withdraw 100 DAI like in this example, you will need to put in `100000000000000000000`. Oh, and make sure that that
amount has already been streamed, you cannot withdraw funds that haven't yet been streamed over to you.

Once ready, click on the "Write" button, and confirm the transaction in your wallet. You are done!

Apart from the main flows, you may be required to do some other actions, usually listed as prerequisites.

## ERC20 Allowances

Before interacting directly with the Sablier V2 [contracts](/contracts/v2/deployments) to
[create a stream](#creating-a-stream) you will need to manually grant proper ERC20 allowances.

### Step 1: Go to token page

Pick a token you want to stream, e.g. [DAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f).
Using its address, visit the token page on Etherscan (in this example, we're using Ethereum):
`https://etherscan.io/token/<INSERT-TOKEN-ADDRESS>`

:::info

To get the address of an asset in the [Sablier Interface](/apps/overview), you can click on its name in the token list
dialog or find an existing stream with that token and click on the icon inside the stream circle.

![Etherscan 09](/img/etherscan-tutorial/09.png) ![Etherscan 10](/img/etherscan-tutorial/10.png)

:::

### Step 2: Go to `approve`

Next, look for the "Contract" tab and the "Write Contract" sub-tab.

You'll see a list of methods that can be called for that token. Pick the `approve` method (e.g.
[DAI's approve](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#writeContract#F1)). Most ERC-20
approve methods will contain two fields:

1. The spender
2. The amount

:::tip

Some tokens like [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?a=#writeProxyContract) or
[AAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9?a=#writeProxyContract) are upgradeable and
use a proxy pattern. For these you have to search for the "Write as Proxy" tab.

:::

### Step 3: Send transaction

For the purpose of creating a **LockupLinear** stream with Sablier V2, the spender will be the
[SablierV2LockupLinear](/contracts/v2/deployments) contract.

As for the amount, you'll have to pad it with the right number of decimals. For DAI, that's 18 decimals, so a value of
`100` will turn into `100 * 1e18` (100 followed by 18 zeroes). For USDC,that's 6 decimals, so a value of `100` will turn
into `100 * 1e8` (100 followed by 8 zeroes). The same logic applies to the [total amounts](#total-amount) when creating
the stream.

```json
{
  "spender": "0xAFb979d9afAd1aD27C5eFf4E27226E3AB9e5dCC9",
  "amount": 100000000000000000000
}
```

![Etherscan 11](/img/etherscan-tutorial/11.png)

Before clicking on the "Write" button to submit your allowance update, make sure to connect your wallet to the interface
by clicking on "Connect to Web3".
