:::info

Due to budget constraints, we are not able to deploy the Sablier Protocol on every EVM chain. However, we are happy to
consider your project if you fill out this <Link href={links.forms.chain}>form</Link> and meet the requirements below.

:::

## Requirements

- Blockchain explorer
- Documentation site
- Bridge, with step-by-step instructions for how to bridge ETH and ERC-20 tokens to the target chain
- GraphQL solution, e.g., a deployment of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)
- Functional JSON-RPC endpoint, ideally listed on [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/)

## Deployment Guide

Have you been granted a [BUSL license](https://app.ens.domains/lockup-license-grants.sablier.eth?tab=records) to deploy
the Sablier Protocol?

This is a guide for how to deploy the Sablier Protocol.

:::warning[Important]

You must set the protocol admin to the Sablier-controlled address 0xD427d37B5F6d33f7D42C4125979361E011FFbfD9. Failure to
do so will result in your deployment not being acknowledged as official.

:::

### Pre Requisities

- Check if the deployment is already made on [your chain](/contracts/v2/deployments)
- Follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- JSON RPC, e.g., a paid Infura account
- Enough ETH in your deployment account
- Etherscan API key (for source code verification)

### Steps

TODO

:::note

You will need to repeat the steps above for both V2 Core and V2 Periphery.
