# Create a Lockup Dynamic stream

Lockup Dynamic are streams with custom streaming curves. In this guide, we will show you how to programmatically create
a Lockup Dynamic stream.

:::note

This guide assumes that you have already read the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/protocol/streaming) section.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.19;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/v2-core`:

```solidity
import { ISablierV2LockupDynamic } from "@sablier/v2-core/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupDynamic.sol";
import { Broker, LockupDynamic } from "@sablier/v2-core/types/DataTypes.sol";
import { ud2x18, ud60x18 } from "@sablier/v2-core/types/Math.sol";
import { IERC20 } from "@sablier/v2-core/types/Tokens.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupDynamicStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and an immutable
variable `sablier` of type `ISablierV2LockupDynamic`:

```solidity
contract LockupDynamicStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F);
    ISablierV2LockupDynamic public immutable sablier;
}
```

In the code above, the address of the [DAI](https://makerdao.com) stablecoin is hard-coded. However, in production, you
would likely use an input parameter to allow the contract to change the assets it interacts with on a per transaction
basis.

## Initialization

To initialize the Sablier contract, you first need to grab its address from the
[Deployment Addresses](/contracts/v2/deployments) page. Once you have obtained it, pass it to the constructor of the
creator contract:

```solidity
constructor(ISablierV2LockupDynamic sablier_) {
    sablier = sablier_;
}
```

## Create functions

There are two create functions in the Lockup Dynamic contract:

- `createWithMilestones`: uses specific start and end times, as well as a predefined list of segment milestones
- `createWithDeltas`: sets the start time to
  [`block.timestamp`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/cheatsheet.html#global-variables), and calculates the end
  time and the segment milestones based on the provided deltas

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithMilestones`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createLockupDynamicStream` which takes two parameters, `amount0` and `amount1`, and which
returns the id of the created stream:

```solidity
function createLockupDynamicStream(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

Next, sum up the `amount0` and `amount1` parameters to get the total amount of the stream, which will be needed in many
of the steps below:

```solidity
uint256 totalAmount = amount0 + amount1;
```

<ERC20Steps />

## Parameters

Sablier uses structs to encode the parameters of its create functions. The struct associated with `createWithDurations`
is [`LockupDynamic.CreateWithMilestones`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/types/library.LockupDynamic), and it can be
initialized like this:

```solidity
LockupDynamic.CreateWithMilestones memory params;
```

Let's review each parameter in detail.

<ParamSender />

<ParamRecipient />

<ParamTotalAmount />

<ParamAsset />

<ParamCancelable />

<ParamBroker />

### Start time

The Unix timestamp for when the stream will start.

In this example, the start time is set to 100 seconds into the future:

```solidity
params.startTime = block.timestamp + 100 seconds;
```

### Segments

Segments are what the protocol uses to compose the custom streaming curve of a Lockup Dynamic stream. For a full
exposition of segments, see the [Segments](/concepts/protocol/segments) guide.

The term "milestones" in the function `createWithMilestones` refers to the splitting of the stream into several distinct
segments, with each segment characterized by a specific amount, exponent, and milestone. These segments are supplied to
the function in the form of an array containing
[`LockupDynamic.Segment`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/types/library.LockupDynamic) structs.

Let's define two dummy segments:

```solidity
params.segments = new LockupDynamic.Segment[](2);
params.segments[0] = LockupDynamic.Segment({
    amount: uint128(amount0),
    exponent: ud2x18(1e18),
    milestone: uint40(block.timestamp + 4 weeks)
});
params.segments[1] = (
    LockupDynamic.Segment({
        amount: uint128(amount1),
        exponent: ud2x18(3.14e18),
        milestone: uint40(block.timestamp + 52 weeks)
    })
);
```

In this example, the first segment (`amount0`) will stream much faster than the second segment (`amount1`), because the
exponents are different. As a rule of thumb: the higher the exponent, the slower the stream.

:::note

The segment milestones must be in ascending order.

:::

:::info

The `ud2x18` function wraps a basic integer to the `UD2x18` value type, which is part of the
[PRBMath](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math) library.

:::

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithMilestones` function, and assign the id of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = lockupDynamic.createWithMilestones(params);
```

## The complete Lockup Dynamic stream creator contract

Below you can see the complete functioning code: a contract that creates Lockup Dynamic streams with predefined segment
milestones. You can access the code on GitHub through
[this link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/LockupDynamicStreamCreator.sol).

```solidity reference title="Lockup Dynamic Stream Creator"
https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/LockupDynamicStreamCreator.sol
```

[^1]: If creating streams on behalf of end users, they will have to approve your contract first.
