# Create a Lockup Linear stream

Lockup Linear are streams with a strictly linear streaming function. In this guide, we will show you how to
programmatically create a Lockup Linear stream.

:::note

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/protocol/streaming) section.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.19;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/v2-core`:

```solidity
import { ISablierV2LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupLinear.sol";
import { Broker, LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/types/DataTypes.sol";
import { ud60x18 } from "@sablier/v2-core/types/Math.sol";
import { IERC20 } from "@sablier/v2-core/types/Tokens.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupLinearStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and an immutable
variable `sablier` of type `ISablierV2LockupLinear`:

```solidity
contract LockupLinearStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F);
    ISablierV2LockupLinear public immutable sablier;
}
```

In the code above, the address of the [DAI](https://makerdao.com) stablecoin is hard-coded. However, in production, you
would likely use an input parameter to allow the contract to change the assets it interacts with on a per transaction
basis.

## Initialization

To initialize the Sablier contract, you first need to grab its address from the
[Deployment Addresses](/contracts/v2/deployments) page. Once you have obtained it, pass it to the constructor of the
creator contract:

```solidity
constructor(ISablierV2LockupLinear sablier_) {
    sablier = sablier_;
}
```

## Create functions

There are two create functions in the Lockup Linear contract:

- `createWithDurations`: sets the start time to
  [`block.timestamp`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/cheatsheet.html#global-variables), and calculates the end
  time based on the provided durations
- `createWithRange`: uses specific start and end times

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurations`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createLockupLinearStream` which takes a single parameter `totalAmount`, and which returns the
id of the created stream:

```solidity
function createLockupLinearStream(uint256 totalAmount) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

<ERC20Steps />

## Parameters

Sablier uses structs to encode the parameters of its create functions. The struct associated with `createWithDurations`
is [`LockupLinear.CreateWithDurations`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/types/library.LockupLinear), and it can be
initialized like this:

```solidity
LockupLinear.CreateWithDurations memory params;
```

Let's review each parameter in detail.

<ParamSender />

<ParamRecipient />

<ParamTotalAmount />

<ParamAsset />

<ParamCancelable />

<ParamBroker />

### Durations

Struct that encapsulates (i) the start time of the stream, (ii) the cliff time of the stream, and (iii) the end time of
the stream, all as Unix timestamps.

```solidity
params.durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 4 weeks,
    total: 52 weeks
});
```

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurations` function, and assign the id of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = lockupLinear.createWithDurations(params);
```

## The complete Lockup Linear stream creator contract

Below you can see the complete functioning code: a contract that creates Lockup Linear streams that start at
`block.timestamp`. You can access the code on GitHub through
[this link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/LockupLinearStreamCreator.sol).

```solidity reference title="Lockup Linear Stream Creator"
https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/core/LockupLinearStreamCreator.sol
```

[^1]: If creating streams on behalf of end users, they will have to approve your contract first.
