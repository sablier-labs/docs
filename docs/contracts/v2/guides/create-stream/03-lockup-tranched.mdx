# Create a Lockup Tranched stream

Lockup Tranched are streams with token unlocks in tranches. In this guide, we will show you how to programmatically
create a Lockup Tranched stream.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/protocol/streaming) section.

:::note

This guide interacts with the Core contracts directly.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.22;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/v2-core`:

```solidity
import { ISablierV2LockupTranched } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupTranched.sol";
import { Broker, LockupTranched } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
import { ud60x18 } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/Math.sol";
import { IERC20 } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/Tokens.sol";
```

Create a contract called `LockupTranchedStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20` and a constant
`LOCKUP_TRANCHED` of type `ISablierV2LockupTranched`:

```solidity
contract LockupTranchedStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F);
    ISablierV2LockupTranched public constant LOCKUP_TRANCHED =
        ISablierV2LockupTranched(0x7CC7e125d83A581ff438608490Cc0f7bDff79127);
}
```

<ConstantsComment />

<CreateFunctions />

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurations`.

## Function definition

Define a function called `createStream` which takes two parameters, `amount0` and `amount1`, and which returns the id of
the created stream:

```solidity
function createStream(uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
  // ...
}
```

Next, sum up the `amount0` and `amount1` parameters to get the total amount of the stream, which will be needed in many
of the steps below:

```solidity
uint256 totalAmount = amount0 + amount1;
```

## ERC-20 steps

To create a stream, the caller must approve the creator contract to pull the tokens from the calling address's account.
Then, we have to also approve the Sablier contract to pull the assets that the creator contract will be in possession of
after they are transferred from the calling address (you):

```solidity
// Transfer the provided amount of DAI tokens to this contract
DAI.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);

// Approve the Sablier contract to spend DAI
DAI.approve(address(LOCKUP_TRANCHED), totalAmount);
```

For more guidance on how to approve and transfer ERC-20 assets, see
[this article](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on the Ethereum website.

## Parameters

Sablier uses structs to encode the parameters of its create functions. The struct associated with `createWithDurations`
is
[`LockupTranched.CreateWithDurations`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/types/library.LockupTranched#createwithdurations),
and it can be initialized like this:

```solidity
LockupTranched.CreateWithDurations memory params;
```

Let's review each parameter in detail.

<ParamSender />

<ParamRecipient />

<ParamTotalAmount />

<ParamAsset />

<ParamCancelable />

<ParamTransferable />

### Tranches With Duration

Tranches are what the protocol uses to compose the Lockup Tranched stream. For a full exposition of tranches, see the
[Tranches](/concepts/protocol/tranches) guide.

Each tranche is characterized by a specific amount, and timestamp. Because we are using `createWithDurations` in this
example, these tranches are supplied to the function in the form of an array containing
[`LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/types/library.LockupTranched#tranchewithduration)
structs.

Let's define two dummy tranches:

```solidity
params.tranches = new LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration[](2);
params.tranches[0] = LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration({
    amount: amount0,
    duration: uint40(4 weeks)
});
params.tranches[1] = (
    LockupTranched.TrancheWithDuration({
        amount: amount1,
        duration: uint40(6 weeks)
    })
);
```

In this example, the first tranche (`amount0`) will unlock at the end of 4 weeks after the stream has been created and
the second tranche (`amount1`) will unlock after further 6 weeks. Thus, the total amount will be unlocked in 10 weeks.

<ParamBroker />

## Invoke the create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurations` function, and assign the id of the newly created
stream to a variable:

```solidity
streamId = LOCKUP_TRANCHED.createWithDurations(params);
```
