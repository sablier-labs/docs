# Create a Batch of Lockup Linear Streams

In this guide, we will show you how to programmatically batch create linear streams via the Sablier's
[Batch](/contracts/v2/reference/periphery/contract.SablierV2Batch) contract.

This guide assumes that you have already gone through the [Protocol Concepts](/concepts/protocol/streaming) section.

:::note

This guide interacts with the Periphery contract.

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.19;
```

Now, import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/v2-core` and `@sablier/v2-periphery`:

```solidity
import { ISablierV2LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupLinear.sol";
import { Broker, LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/LockupLinear.sol";
import { ud60x18 } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/Math.sol";
import { IERC20 } from "@sablier/v2-core/src/types/Tokens.sol";
import { ISablierV2Batch } from "@sablier/v2-periphery/src/interfaces/ISablierV2Batch.sol";
import { Batch} from "@sablier/v2-periphery/src/types/DataTypes.sol";
```

Create a contract called `BatchLockupLinearStreamCreator`, and declare a constant `DAI` of type `IERC20`, a constant
`LOCKUP_LINEAR` of type `ISablierV2LockupLinear`, and a constant `BATCH` of type `ISablierV2Batch`:

```solidity
contract BatchLockupLinearStreamCreator {
    IERC20 public constant DAI = IERC20(0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F);
    ISablierV2LockupLinear public constant LOCKUP_LINEAR =
        ISablierV2LockupLinear(0xAFb979d9afAd1aD27C5eFf4E27226E3AB9e5dCC9);
    ISablierV2Batch public constant BATCH = ISablierV2Batch(0xEa07DdBBeA804E7fe66b958329F8Fa5cDA95Bd55);
}
```

## Batch create functions

There are two batch create functions for the Lockup Linear contract:

- [`createWithDurations`](/contracts/v2/reference/periphery/contract.SablierV2Batch#createwithdurations)
- [`createWithRange`](/contracts/v2/reference/periphery/contract.SablierV2Batch#createwithrange)

Which one you choose depends upon your use case. In this guide, we will use `createWithDurations`.

<BatchCommonSteps />

## Stream Parameters

Given that we declared a `batchSize` of two, we need to define two
[Batch.CreateWithDurations](/contracts/v2/reference/periphery/types/library.Batch#createwithdurations) structs:

```solidity
// Declare the first stream in the batch
Batch.CreateWithDurations memory stream0;
stream0.sender = address(0xABCD); // The sender to stream the assets, he will be able to cancel the stream
stream0.recipient = address(0xCAFE); // The recipient of the streamed assets
stream0.totalAmount = perStreamAmount; // The total amount of each stream, inclusive of all fees
stream0.cancelable = true; // Whether the stream will be cancelable or not
stream0.durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 4 weeks, // Assets will be unlocked only after 4 weeks
    total: 52 weeks // Setting a total duration of ~1 year
  });
stream0.broker = Broker(address(0), ud60x18(0)); // Optional parameter left undefined
```

To add some variety, we will change the parameters of the second stream:

```solidity
// Declare the second stream in the batch
Batch.CreateWithDurations memory stream1;
stream1.sender = address(0xABCD); // The sender to stream the assets, he will be able to cancel the stream
stream1.recipient = address(0xBEEF); // The recipient of the streamed assets
stream1.totalAmount = perStreamAmount; // The total amount of each stream, inclusive of all fees
stream1.cancelable = false; // Whether the stream will be cancelable or not
stream1.durations = LockupLinear.Durations({
    cliff: 1 weeks, // Assets will be unlocked only after 1 week
    total: 26 weeks // Setting a total duration of ~6 months
  });
stream1.broker = Broker(address(0), ud60x18(0)); // Optional parameter left undefined
```

Once both structs are declared, the batch array has to be filled:

```solidity
// Fill the batch param
Batch.CreateWithDurations[] memory batch = new Batch.CreateWithDurations[](batchSize);
batch[0] = stream0;
batch[1] = stream1;
```

## Invoke the batch create function

With all parameters set, we can now call the `createWithDurations` function, and assign the ids of the newly created
streams to the array:

```solidity
streamIds = BATCH.createWithDurations(LOCKUP_LINEAR, DAI, batch);
```

## The complete Batch Lockup Linear stream creator contract

Below you can see the complete functioning code: a contract that batch creates Lockup Linear streams using Sablier's
`Batch` that start at `block.timestamp`. You can access the code on GitHub through this
[link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/periphery/BatchLockupLinearStreamCreator.sol).
