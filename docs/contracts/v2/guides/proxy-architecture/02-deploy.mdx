# Deploy Proxy and Install Plugin

import AdmonitionSimpleCode from "@site/docs/snippets/AdmonitionSimpleCode.mdx";

## Context

In this guide, we will show you how to programmatically deploy a proxy and install the official Sablier plugin.

While the proxy architecture offers many benefits, it presents us with a challenge in a particular circumstance. When a
recipient cancels a stream, the protocol transfers the sender's refund to the proxy contract. To improve the user
experience, we wrote a specialized plugin that can be installed on the proxy contract to auto-forward the refunded
assets back to the original user.

<AdmonitionSimpleCode />

## Set up a contract

Declare the Solidity version used to compile the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.19;
```

Import the relevant symbols from `@sablier/v2-periphery`:

```solidity
import { IPRBProxy, IPRBProxyRegistry } from "@sablier/v2-periphery/types/Proxy.sol";
import { ISablierV2ProxyPlugin } from "@sablier/v2-periphery/interfaces/ISablierV2ProxyPlugin.sol";
```

Create a contract called `ProxyDeployerAndPluginInstaller`, and declare a constant `PROXY_REGISTRY` of type
`IPRBProxyRegistry` and an immutable variable `proxyPlugin` of type `ISablierV2ProxyPlugin`:

```solidity
contract ProxyDeployerAndPluginInstaller {
    IPRBProxyRegistry public constant PROXY_REGISTRY = IPRBProxyRegistry(0x584009E9eDe26e212182c9745F5c000191296a78);
    ISablierV2ProxyPlugin public immutable proxyPlugin;
}
```

:::info

The `PRBProxyRegistry` contract is deployed at the same address across all chains. You can see a list of all deployments
[here](https://prbproxy.com/deployments).

:::

## Initialization

To initialize the address of the Sablier `ProxyPlugin` contract, you first need to grab its address from the
[Deployment Addresses](/contracts/v2/addresses) page. Once you have obtained it, pass it to the constructor of the
deployer contract:

```solidity
constructor(ISablierV2ProxyPlugin proxyPlugin_) {
    proxyPlugin = proxyPlugin_;
}
```

## Function definition

Define a function called `deployProxyAndInstallPlugin` which returns the `proxy` of the contract itself:

```solidity
function deployProxyAndInstallPlugin() public returns (IPRBProxy proxy) {
    // ...
}
```

## Steps

First, check if the proxy already exists:

```solidity
// Get the proxy for this contract
proxy = PROXY_REGISTRY.getProxy({ user: address(this) });
```

Second, deploy the proxy and install the plugin if the proxy doesn't exist, or otherwise just install the plugin:

```solidity
if (address(proxy) == address(0)) {
    // If a proxy doesn't exist, deploy one and install the plugin
    proxy = PROXY_REGISTRY.deployAndInstallPlugin({ plugin: proxyPlugin });
} else {
    // If the proxy exists, then just install the plugin.
    PROXY_REGISTRY.installPlugin({ plugin: proxyPlugin });
}
```

:::note

There can only be one PRBProxy contract per address. If you try to deploy a proxy for an address that already has one,
the transaction will revert.

## The complete deployer contract

Below you can see the complete functioning code: a contract that queries the registry, deploys the proxy if it doesn't
exist, and installs the plugin. You can access the code on GitHub through
[this link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/periphery/DeployProxyAndInstallPlugin.sol).
