In this guide, we will show you how to programmatically create a single stream via the proxy and Sablier's `ProxyTarget`

Creating single streams via the proxy is similar to creating batches of streams. Refer to the
[previous guide](/contracts/v2/guides/proxy-architecture/batch-stream) for step-by-step instructions; for brevity, we
will not repeat them here.

## Create single functions

There are four create functions in the `ProxyTarget` contract, two for each Lockup contract:

- [`createWithDurations`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/contract.SablierV2LockupLinear#createwithdurations)
- [`createWithRange`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/contract.SablierV2LockupLinear#createwithrange)
- [`createWithDeltas`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/contract.SablierV2LockupDynamic#createwithdeltas)
- [`createWithMilestones`](/contracts/v2/reference/core/contract.SablierV2LockupDynamic#createwithmilestones)

## The complete Single Lockup Linear stream creator contract

Below you can see a complete example of a contract that creates a single Lockup Linear stream via the proxy and
Sablier's `ProxyTarget` that starts at `block.timestamp`. You can access the code on GitHub through this
[link](https://github.com/sablier-labs/examples/blob/main/v2/periphery/SingleLockupLinearStreamCreator.sol).
