"All Chains" means most of the chains supported by Sablier, e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, Polygon. The full list can
be found [here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/blob/main/packages/constants/src).

:::tip Unified Endpoint

As you can see, Envio offers a single API endpoint that aggregates data across all chains. This approach differs from
other indexers like The Graph, which require separate subgraphs for each chain where Sablier is deployed.
