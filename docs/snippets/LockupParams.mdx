Let's review each parameter in detail.

### Broker

An optional parameter that can be set in order to charge a fee as a percentage of `totalAmount`.

In the following example, we will leave this parameter uninitialized (i.e. set to zero), because it doesn't make sense
to charge yourself a fee. In practice, this parameter will mostly be used by front-end applications.

```solidity
params.broker = Broker(address(0), ud60x18(0));
```

:::info

Wondering what's up with that `ud60x18` function? It's a casting function that wraps a basic integer to the `UD60x18`
value type. This type is part of the math library [PRBMath](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math), which is used in
Sablier for fixed-point calculations.

### Cancelable

Boolean that indicates whether the stream will be cancelable or not.

```solidity
params.cancelable = true;
```

### Recipient

The address receiving the tokens:

```solidity
params.recipient = address(0xCAFE);
```

### Sender

The address streaming the tokens, with the ability to cancel the stream:

```solidity
params.sender = msg.sender;
```

### Token

The contract address of the ERC-20 token used for streaming. In this example, we will stream DAI:

```solidity
params.token = DAI;
```

### Total amount

The total amount of ERC-20 tokens to be paid, including the stream deposit and any potential [fees](/concepts/fees), all
denoted in units of the asset's decimals.

```solidity
params.totalAmount = totalAmount;
```

### Transferable

Boolean that indicates whether the stream will be transferable or not.

```solidity
params.transferable = true;
```
