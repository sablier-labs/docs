## Create functions

There are two create functions in the Lockup Linear contract:

- `createWithDurations`: sets the start time to
  [`block.timestamp`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/cheatsheet.html#global-variables), and calculates the end
  time based on the provided durations
- `createWithTimestamps`: uses specific start and end times
