In the code above, the contract addresses are hard-coded for demonstration purposes. However, in production, you would
likely use input parameters to allow flexibility in changing the addresses.

Also, these addresses are deployed on Mainnet. If you need to work with a different chain, the Sablier addresses can be
obtained from the [Deployment Addresses](/contracts/v2/deployments) page.
