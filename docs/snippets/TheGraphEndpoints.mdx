The Decentralized Network subgraphs operate on The Graph Network, so the links in the table below contain a placeholder
for an API key. Here's an example:

```text
https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/API_KEY/subgraphs/id/AvDAMYYHGaEwn9F9585uqq6MM5CfvRtYcb7KjK7LKPCt
```

You have to replace the `API_KEY` placeholder with your own API key. To create your API key, check out
[this guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/studio/managing-api-keys/).

If you don't see your chain in this table, it means that there is no subgraph available for it. You can use the Envio
indexer instead.
