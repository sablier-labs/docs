## Introduction

Welcome to the Sablier on Solana documentation.

This section assumes you are familiar with the Sablier Protocol and its Ethereum implementation. Here, we focus on what's specific to the Solana blockchain and how it differs from Ethereum.

For more information on the original Sablier Protocol, refer to the [main documentation](../concepts/01-what-is-sablier.mdx).
You can also find information about [Streaming](../concepts/02-streaming.md) and
[Airdrops](../concepts/05-merkle-airdrops.mdx) in the Concepts section.

## SolSab

[SolSab](https://github.com/sablier-labs/solsab) is a collection of protocols featuring two main Solana programs: **Sablier Lockup** and **Sablier Merkle Instant**. While not all protocols available for Ethereum are currently available for Solana, we aim to bring the same protocols to Solana in future iterations.

Unlike Ethereum, the programs here adhere to the best practices of Solana development and are **upgradeable** for
greater security.

### Lockup

The official deployment can be found at the address: `4EauRKrNErKfsR4XetEZJNmvACGHbHnHV4R5dvJuqupC`

- [Mainnet](https://solscan.io/account/4EauRKrNErKfsR4XetEZJNmvACGHbHnHV4R5dvJuqupC)
- [Devnet](https://solscan.io/account/4EauRKrNErKfsR4XetEZJNmvACGHbHnHV4R5dvJuqupC?cluster=devnet)

Sablier Lockup is a token distribution protocol that enables onchain vesting and payments. Our flagship model is the
linear stream, which distributes tokens on a continuous, by-the-second basis.

The way it works is that the sender of a payment stream first deposits a specific amount of SPL or Token2022 tokens in
a program. The program then progressively allocates the funds to the recipient, who can access them as they become
available over time. The payment rate is influenced by various factors, including the start and end times, as well as
the total amount of tokens deposited.

#### Key differences from the [Ethereum Lockup protocol](../concepts/lockup/01-overview.md)

- The Solana program includes only the Linear streaming model, not the Dynamic and Tranched models. See the available shapes for the Linear model
  [here](../concepts/lockup/02-stream-shapes.mdx#lockup-linear).
- Due to limitations of the NFT protocols implemented in the Solana ecosystem ([Metaplex](https://developers.metaplex.com/)), we cannot have non-transferable NFTs. For
  more information about NFTs, please see [here](../concepts/08-nft.mdx).
- Tokens transferred during stream creation are placed in a dedicated Stream ATA ([Associated Token Account](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/associated-token-account)), instead of all tokens being held in the Lockup contract as on Ethereum.
- We do not have hooks for the `cancel` and `withdraw` functionalities due to limitations in how Solana works.

### Merkle Instant

The official deployment can be found at the address: `7XrxoQejBoGouW4V3aozTSwub7xSDjYqB4Go7YLjF9rV`

- [Mainnet](https://solscan.io/account/7XrxoQejBoGouW4V3aozTSwub7xSDjYqB4Go7YLjF9rV)
- [Devnet](https://solscan.io/account/7XrxoQejBoGouW4V3aozTSwub7xSDjYqB4Go7YLjF9rV?cluster=devnet)

Merkle Instant is a program that enables the creation of token airdrop campaigns using Merkle trees, allowing users to
instantly claim and receive their allocation through a single transaction.

#### Key differences from Ethereum [Airdrops](../concepts/05-merkle-airdrops.mdx) protocols

- The Solana program includes only the Instant airdrop model, not the Vesting airdrop models.
- Due to the nature of Solana's account architecture, there is a single program for both creating an airdrop and claiming it, unlike on Ethereum where we have a factory contract and its respective campaign contracts deployed.
