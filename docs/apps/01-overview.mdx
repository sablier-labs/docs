## The Sablier Interface

The best way to interact with the Sablier V2 Protocol is through the official client interface. Head over to
[sablier.com](https://sablier.com) to read more about the product or directly to
[app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com) to create your first stream!

## Features

To get a basic understanding of what's possible within the V2 interface, [here's a primer](/apps/features) on the core
features.

## Guides

We've created a couple of tutorials and guides to help you interact with the client applications. From creating a stream
to withdrawing or setting up a group of stream with a [Safe](https://safe.global/) multisig, we've got you covered.

[See guides](/apps/guides)

## Sablier V1

The first version of the Sablier interfaces, will remain available to all users. For new streams we couldn't be more
excited for you to try our V2 app (and protocol), so we suggest you begin your journey directly from
[sablier.com](https://sablier.com).

#### Compatibility

The V2 interface is not compatible with the V1 protocol so we recommend using the legacy V1 apps to manage any streams
previously created withing the V1 ecosystem. For the sender interface, head over to
[v1-pay.sablier.com](https://v1-pay.sablier.com). For the recipient portal, head over to
[v1-app.sablier.com](https://v1-app.sablier.com).
