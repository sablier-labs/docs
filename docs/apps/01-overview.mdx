## The Sablier Interface

The best way to interact with the Sablier V2 Protocol is through the official client interface. Visit our landing page
at [sablier.com](https://sablier.com) for a presentation of what the protocol can do, or go directly to
[app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com) to create your first stream.

## Features

To get a grasp of what's possible with the V2 interface, we've put together a [primer](/apps/features) on the core
features.

## Guides

We've created a couple of tutorials and guides to help you interact with the client applications. From creating a stream
to withdrawing or setting up a group of stream with a [Safe multisig](https://safe.global), we've got you covered.

[See guides](/apps/guides)

## Sablier V1

The first version of the Sablier protocol will keep running in perpetuity thanks to the Ethereum blockchain, but the V2
interface is not compatible with the V1 protocol. We will keep hosting the legacy apps so that you can manage any
streams previously created on V1.
