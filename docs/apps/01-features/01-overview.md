# The Sablier Interface

The Sablier Interface is a web application that allows users to interact with the Sablier Protocol. It is a
user-friendly interface that enables users to create, manage, and interact with streams.

Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com) or continue reading below to learn more about the
available features.

## Use-case centric

The app is split among three use cases:

| Use Case | Smart Contracts Involved              | Description                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vesting  | Sablier Lockup                        | Closed-ended streams with and an end time and funds deposited upfront   |
| Payments | Sablier Flow                          | Open-ended streams that can be topped up over time                      |
| Airdrops | Sablier MerkleFactory, Sablier Lockup | Instant or vested over time, with pre-configured recipients and amounts |

These features are enabled by two types of streams:

- Lockup streams - <i>fixed duration, amount required upfront, strict distribution curve</i>
- Flow streams - <i>no end time, amount can be topped-up, rate-per-second can be adjusted</i>

The Sablier Interface has adapted the Sablier Protocol for the use cases mentioned above, but we encourage you to
explore other applications.
