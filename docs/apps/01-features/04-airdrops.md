# Airdrops

Sablier provides a solution for launching airdrops with up to a million recipients. This is designed to help projects
distribute tokens to a large number of users in a fair and efficient manner. Start exploring at
[app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com/airdrops/) or read more about it on
[sablier.com/airdrops](https://sablier.com/airdrops).

## Airstreams (Vested Airdrops)

![Banner Airdrops Vesting](/img/banners/docs-airdrops-airstreams.webp)

**Airdrops should be vested!**

At Sablier, we believe in long-term distributions with aligned incentives. That's why we engineered Airstreams, a
solution which allows you to airdrop streams with a vesting schedule.

Pick a vesting curve (e.g., linear), define the rules (e.g. duration, clawback window), and allow recipients to claim
their airdrops as vesting streams.

## Instant Airdrops

Sablier also offers an instant airdrop solution, meaning the tokens are immediately released to the recipients upon
claiming.

## Features

### Create with CSV

Generate your list of recipients and put it into a CSV file, upload it to our app, and we'll take care of the rest. We
will sanitize, validate and triple-check the data to ensure everything is formatted correctly.

:::caution Timezone Caveat

All times in the CSV are considered to be in the same timezone as the airdrop creator's device. Visit our
[CSV guide](/apps/guides/csv-support) to read more about the format.

### Easy 3-step process

Creating campaigns involves a simple 3-step process:

1. Configure the initial details (e.g., token, campaign name, etc.)
2. Upload the CSV containing the recipient data
3. Deploy the Airdrop campaign contract

### Support for any ERC-20 token

You can drop your own token!

Thanks to our integration of Token Lists, any ERC-20 token can be airdropped on Sablier.

For your token logo to show up in the Sablier app, add it to our
[token list](https://github.com/sablier-labs/community-token-list/issues/new?template=token-request.md)

### Geographical Restrictions

As shown in the image above, you can specify a list of countries where access to the campaign will be restricted on the
Sablier Interface at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com). Note that this restriction does not apply to the
Sablier Protocol, which runs permissionlessly on the blockchain.

Additionally, some jurisdictions may already be restricted by default â€” either by your ISP or Vercel, our hosting
provider.
