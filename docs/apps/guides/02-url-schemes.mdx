The Sablier Interface makes it easy for integrators to direct their users to specific resources. In this guide, we will
cover a number of resource locators used by the apps, as well as dive into how you can understand and re-create them.

## Stream Page

### Elements

Every stream created through the Sablier Protocols is identified through three parameters:

- a **chainId** (e.g. `1` for Ethereum, `10` for [Optimism](https://chainlist.org/) )
- a **contract** address (e.g. `0x12..AB`) OR an **alias** (e.g. `LL`)
- a **streamId** (generated at stream creation)

#### Contract Aliases

Sablier Lockup supports multiple versions and variants of streaming contracts, e.g. `SablierV2LockupLinear` and
`SablierV2LockupDynamic`. To provide a visual resolver, while also accounting for future stream curves (backwards
compatibility), we alias the contract addresses with the following abbreviations:

- Lockup Linear V2.0 contracts become `LL`, e.g. `LL-137-1`
- Lockup Linear V2.1 contracts become `LL2`, e.g. `LL2-137-1`
- Lockup Dynamic V2.0 contracts become `LD`, e.g. `LD-137-1`
- Lockup Dynamic V2.1 contracts become `LD2`, e.g. `LD2-137-1`

### Building the URL

By combining the elements described above, you can send users from your interface directly to the create stream page in
the Sablier Interface. To build the link to a stream resource, you use a hyphen `-` to concatenate the uppercase
contract `alias`, the `chainId`, and the `streamId`, and then you add them to the base URL `app.sablier.com/stream/`:

| URL                                                                                                                     | Description                               |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| [app.sablier.com/stream/LL2-137-29](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL2-137-29)                                          | Lockup Linear V2.1 stream #29 on Polygon  |
| [app.sablier.com/stream/LL-137-32](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL-137-32)                                            | Lockup Linear V2.0 stream #32 on Polygon  |
| [app.sablier.com/stream/LD-137-13](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LD-137-13)                                            | Lockup Dynamic V2.0 stream #13 on Polygon |
| [app.sablier.com/stream/LL-1-6](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL-1-6)                                                  | Lockup Linear V2.0 stream #6 on Ethereum  |
| [app.sablier.com/stream/0xB10...f95-1-6](https://app.sablier.com/stream/0xB10daee1FCF62243aE27776D7a92D39dC8740f95-1-6) | Lockup Linear V2.0 stream #6 on Ethereum  |
| [app.sablier.com/stream/LL2-11155111-40](https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL2-11155111-40)                                | Lockup Linear V2.1 stream #40 on Sepolia  |

As you can see, the main format is `contractA-chainId-streamId`. This is supported both at the app and the subgraph
level. For situations when an alias cannot be used, we fallback to the following format:
`contractAddress-chainId-streamId`. Read more about identifiers and aliases in our
[subgraph documentation](/api/lockup/the-graph/structure#identifying).

## Search Streams

### Elements

The Sablier Interface comes with an advanced search view that can be accessed directly through URL parameters. If you
want to use this feature, here is a table with all the available parameters:

| Parameter | Type         | Description                                                                | Values                                                                    |
| :-------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| t         | String       | The active tab in the dashboard. For global queries, use `search`.         | `search`, `sender`, or `recipient`                                        |
| c         | Number       | The chain of the streams in the search result. This parameter is required. | `1`, `10`, `42161` or other [supported chain](/guides/lockup/deployments) |
| s         | String       | The address of the stream sender by which to filter                        | `0x12...AB`, `vitalik.eth`                                                |
| r         | String       | The address of the stream recipient by which to filter                     | `0x12...AB`, `vitalik.eth`                                                |
| a         | String       | The address of the asset to filter for                                     | `0x12...CD` for DAI                                                       |
| i         | String array | An array of IDs to look up                                                 | `LL-5-1`, `LD-5-14` etc.                                                  |

### Building the URL

By combining the parameters described above, you can send users from your interface directly to the search view in the
Sablier Interface. To build the link, you append all these elements to the base link `app.sablier.com/` as query
parameters, e.g. `?t=search&c=1&s=0x..1&r=0x...2&i=LL-1-2,LL2-1-29`.

Here are some examples of URLs and the associated search modal for each:

|                                                                                                                            |                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Streams created by a particular user](https://app.sablier.com/?t=search&c=1&s=0x0aAeF7BbC21c627f14caD904E283e199cA2b72cC) | ![Form](/screenshots/search-with-sender.webp) |
| [Streams with particular IDs](https://app.sablier.com/?t=search&c=1&i=LL2-1-2,LL-1-29)                                     | ![Form](/screenshots/search-with-ids.webp)    |

## Airstream Page

|                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Airstream profile](/screenshots/airstream-profile.webp) |

### Elements

Every airstream created through the Lockup protocol is identified through three parameters:

- a **chainId** (e.g. `1` for Ethereum, `10` for [Optimism](https://chainlist.org/) )
- a **contract** address (e.g. `0x12..AB`)

:::info

We've chosen not to apply aliases to Airstreams for now. In the future, we may ask the campaign creator to provide a
name or an alias to be used in the URL.

### Building the URL

By combining the elements described above, you can send users from your interface directly to the create stream page in
the Sablier Interface. To build the link to a stream resource, you use a hyphen `-` to concatenate the uppercase
contract `alias`, the `chainId`, and the `streamId`, and then you add them to the base URL `app.sablier.com/stream/`:

| URL                                                                                                                                       | Description          |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |

As you can see, the main format is `contractA-chainId`. This is supported both at the app and the subgraph level. Read
more about identifiers and aliases in our [subgraph documentation](/api/airdrops/the-graph/entities#identifying).
