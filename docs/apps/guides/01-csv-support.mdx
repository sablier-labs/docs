The Sablier Interface provides a number of **advanced** features using templated CSV files. Bellow you can find a list
of all these features that help automate medium to large scale distributions.

:::warning Formatting Caveats

**Dates**: All the columns that use the "date" type should have the following format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm".

**Durations**: All the columns that use the "duration" type should have the following format: "**x** years **y** days
**z** hours". Note that each particle is optional, e.g., you can skip the days.

**Timezones**: The dates and times extracted from the CSV are processed using the same timezone as the locales of the
client's device.

**Amounts**: All the amounts should be expressed in humanized notion. They will be padded with the selected token's
number of decimals in the processing step.

## Streams: Create Group

Using a pre-configured CSV, deploy up to 60+ streams, all onchain, all at once. Start from the suggested template, fill
in rows with addresses, amounts and other details. Finally, create batches/groups of streams in a single transaction.

### Navigation

In order to access this feature you will need to:

1. Access the create streams [gallery](https://app.sablier.com/vesting/gallery/) - make sure you're on the group tab
   (top right)
2. Click on the the desired stream shape card
3. At the top (top-right) of the page you will find a button guiding you towards the CSV feature

|                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![CSV Selector](/screenshots/create-group-csv-selector.webp) |

### Form Layout

The Create Group From CSV form consists of two parts:

#### Part 1: General Details

In this part of the form you should fill in the general details that all streams have in common. This step is similar to
the regular create group forms, with the addition of a "timing" field that toggles between time configurations:

1. By duration: e.g. streams end 30 days from now
2. By range: e.g. streams being on `start time` and last until `end time`

|                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![General Details](/screenshots/create-group-csv-general-details.webp) |

#### Part 2: Streams

This area consists of a large file picker. As soon as a file is uploaded it displays a table containing every stream and
its primary details.

:::info

To double-check all columns provided through the CSV, click on the table (or action button at the top) and open the
expanded table view.

### Working with the CSV template

For each stream shape and duration you can use a different CSV template. You can download this template directly from
the form, pre-configured to the selected **shape** and **timing** option.

### Columns and Caveats

In order to properly use the CSV create feature you will have to provide data in the proper format for each column.
Bellow you can find a list with each possible column, a short description and an example value.

:::info

If editing the CSV in Google Spreadsheets or similar applications, make sure that these formats are not overridden by
the app itself. We suggest double-checking in the Sablier app that the dates have been parsed as expected.

## Airstreams: Create

|                                               |                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Create](/screenshots/airstream-create.webp) | ![Create](/screenshots/airstream-create-recipients.webp) |

Using a pre-configured CSV, deploy tens of thousands of streams, all onchain, all in one campaign. Start from the
suggested template, fill in rows with addresses, amounts and other details. Finally, create the airstream campaign in a
single transaction. Recipients will be able to start claiming their streams as soon as the campaign is deployed and
funded.

### Navigation

In order to access this feature you will need to:

1. Access the [create airstream](https://app.sablier.com/airstream/create/) page
2. Continue to the second step to enable uploading the CSV

### Working with the CSV template

Working with the CSV template is pretty straightforward and similar to what we discussed in the previous guide (creating
stream groups).

:::info

For now, creating airstreams is only possible using Lockup Linear contracts, no cliff and a "duration"-driven timing.
Therefore, you don't have to worry about multiple templates or different configurations.

For convenience, here's a table with the main template:
