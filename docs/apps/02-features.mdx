Protocol, and more. Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com).

## Interact with the Sablier contracts

We've mapped the most important utilities from the V2 contracts into in-app features. Interact with streams that
reference you as a key participant (e.g. sender, recipient) directly from the interfaces.
