The Sablier V2 interface has been redesigned from the ground up to support all the new features of the Sablier V2
Protocol, and more. Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com).

## Flexible payments

Almost any payment schedule can be expressed as a stream. Sablier V2 supports the following options out of the box:

- Linear
- Cliff-Linear
- Unlock in Steps
- Timelock
- Unlock-Linear
- Unlock-Dynamic
- Exponential
- Cliff-Exponential

But programmatically, you can create any schedule you want. See the [Types of Streams](/concepts/protocol/stream-types)
for more details.

## NFT Representation

Each stream in wrapped in an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT), making the stream recipient the owner of the NFT.

Thus streams can be transferred, traded, and used as collateral in NFT lending protocols.

## Interact with the Sablier contracts

We've mapped the most important utilities from the V2 contracts into in-app features. Interact with streams that
reference you as a key participant (e.g. sender, recipient) directly from the interfaces.

| Feature                | Sender | Recipient |
| ---------------------- | :----: | :-------: |
| Create Streams         |   ‚úÖ   |    ‚ùå     |
| Renounce Cancelability |   ‚úÖ   |    ‚ùå     |
| Cancel                 |   ‚úÖ   |    ‚ùå     |
| Cancel Multiple        |   ‚úÖ   |    ‚ùå     |
