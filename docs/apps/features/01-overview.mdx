# The Sablier Interface

The app has been redesigned from the ground up around Lockup, Flow, Airstreams and the Sablier Protocols as a whole.
Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com) or dive into some of the main features below.

## Use-case centric

As you may have noticed the protocol support two types of streams:

- Lockup streams - <i>fixed duration, amount required upfront, strict distribution curve</i>
- Flow streams - <i>no end time, amount can be topped-up, rate-per-second can be adjusted</i>

Therefore, we have mapped Sablier's two underlying protocols to dedicated use-cases our customers may choose them for.
Our approach is to consider:

| Feature  | Underlying System          | Reason                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vesting  | Sablier Lockup             | Well defined rules and strict schedules                                 |
| Payments | Sablier Flow               | Adapts with time, less collateral-intensive for senders                 |
| Drops    | Sablier Lockup, Airstreams | Instant or vested over time, with pre-configured recipients and amounts |

However, we invite everyone to use these features without any constraints and adapt them to their own unique use-case.
