# Vesting

import LockupNFTSVG from "@site/static/img/lockup-nft.svg";

The Sablier Interface will showcase [Lockup](/concepts/lockup/overview) streams under the Vesting tab. These are token
streams with a fixed duration, predefined amount and strict distribution curve.

In Q4 2024 the app has undergone a use-case centric redesign. For past users, all streams created before this update
will show up in the Vesting page.

## Features

### Flexible curves

Almost any vesting schedule can be expressed as a stream. Sablier supports multiple options out of the box, including:

- Linear
- Cliff-Linear
- Unlock in Steps
- Unlock Monthly
- Backweighted
- Timelock
- Unlock-Linear
- Unlock-Dynamic
- Exponential
- Cliff-Exponential

But programmatically, you can create any schedule you want. See the [Stream Shapes](/concepts/lockup/stream-shapes) for
more details on how we design these shapes.

### Explore the dashboard

Enter the Dashboard and discover a detailed overview of your incoming and outgoing streams.

Take advantage of the Search functionality to explore the chain and gain more insight into how others are using Lockup
for vesting.

### Preview any stream

Gain insight into any stream. Track progress using our very own stream circle. Share the unique URL with recipients or
anyone really to increase transparency of your day to day token distribution.

### NFT representation

Each stream in wrapped in an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT), making the stream recipient the owner of the NFT.

Thus streams can be transferred, traded, and used as collateral in NFT lending protocols.

### Create from CSVs

Save even more time by using our CSV upload, dedicated to power-users. Under the hood, it works the same as the visual
forms.

### Permissions

We've mapped the most important utilities from the Lockup contracts into in-app features. Interact with streams that
reference you as a key participant (e.g. sender, recipient) directly from the interfaces.
