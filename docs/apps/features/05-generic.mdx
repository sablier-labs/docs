# Generic features

The Sablier Interface includes a ton of smaller (but cool) features, from small design aspects to popular integrations
(e.g. Farcaster [Frames](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/frames)).

### Auto-Generated Preview Images

For the stars of our show, we generated special preview images based on the qualities of each entity. Share these on
social media for an extra bit of glamour. Here's an [example](https://x.com/Sablier/status/1798010170133692730) on X.

To see what your preview looks like, paste the stream URL (e.g. `app.sablier.com/stream/...`) on socials or looks for
the "Share custom image feature" button (Stream Profile → More Options → Share Stream).

favorite client and interact with Sablier directly from the app.
