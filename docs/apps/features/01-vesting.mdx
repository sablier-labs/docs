# Vesting

import NFTSVG from "@site/static/img/nft.svg";

The Sablier Interface has been redesigned from the ground up to support all the new features of the protocol, and then
some. Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com).

## Flexible vesting

Almost any vesting schedule can be expressed as a stream. Sablier supports multiple options out of the box, including:

- Linear
- Cliff-Linear
- Unlock in Steps
- Unlock Monthly
- Timelock
- Unlock-Linear
- Unlock-Dynamic
- Exponential
- Cliff-Exponential

But programmatically, you can create any schedule you want. See the [Types of Streams](/concepts/lockup/stream-types)
for more details on how we design these shapes.

## NFT Representation

Each stream in wrapped in an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT), making the stream recipient the owner of the NFT.

Thus streams can be transferred, traded, and used as collateral in NFT lending protocols.

## Interact with the Lockup contracts

We've mapped the most important utilities from the Lockup contracts into in-app features. Interact with streams that
reference you as a key participant (e.g. sender, recipient) directly from the interfaces.

| Feature                | Sender | Recipient |
| ---------------------- | :----: | :-------: |
| Create Streams         |   ✅   |    ❌     |
| Renounce Cancelability |   ✅   |    ❌     |
| Cancel                 |   ✅   |    ❌     |
| Cancel Multiple        |   ✅   |    ❌     |
| Transfer               |   ❌   |    ✅     |
| Withdraw               |   ✅   |    ✅     |

## Stream from your Safe multisig

Lockup is fully integrated with [Safe](https://safe.global). Start streaming from the safety and comfort of your
multisig wallet.

## Do it with style!

Yes, the app works on mobile. And yes, we support dark mode by default (light mode coming soon).
