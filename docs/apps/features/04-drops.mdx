# Drops

The Sablier Interface can handle more than native streams. We developed a solution for distributing token streams to
millions of users called **Drops**. Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com/drops/) or read more
about it on [sablier.com/drops](https://sablier.com/drops).

:::note

Drops allow for millions of recipients to receive an allocation. To see how they differ from
[group streams](/apps/features/vesting#create-in-batches) (~60 streams at once) read our [FAQ](/support/faq).

## Airstreams

**Airdrops should be vested!**

Here at Sablier we believe in long-term distributions that align incentives. That's why we engineered Airstreams, a
solution which allows you to airdrop streams to a very large number of recipients.

Pick a vesting curve (e.g. linear or stepper), define the rules (e.g. duration, clawback window) and allow recipients to
claim their allocations as streams.

## Instant Drops (Coming Soon ðŸ”œ)

![Banner Instant Drops](/banner/docs-banner-drops-instant.png)

For communities that are still looking to distribute value quickly and efficiently, Sablier offers a one-time instant
airdrop solution. This facilitates and easy onboarding of millions of users into the campaign creator's ecosystem, while
exposing everyone to the amazing features our products can offer.

## Features

### Create from CSVs

Pre-generate the list of recipients and drop the file right into our app. We sanitize, validate and triple-check the
data to ensure everything is formatted correctly.

:::caution Timezone Caveat

All the dates and times in the CSV are considered to be in the same timezone as the locales of the airstream creator's
device. Visit out [Guide for CSV Support](/apps/guides/csv-support) to read about timezones, date or amount formats and
more.

### Easy 3-step process

Create a campaign by following these three simple steps:

1. Configure the initial details (e.g., token, cancelability)
2. Upload the CSV containing a list of recipients
3. Deploy and fund the Airstream campaign contract (can be funded later)

### Public source

You can distribute a large number of streams per campaign through our app. If you'd like to support Drops in your own UI
or have additional requirements, you can do so by using a self-hosted [Merkle service](/api/merkle-api/overview). Feel
free to get in touch for more details or premium support.

### Support for any ERC-20 token

Drop your own token! Thanks to our integration of Token Lists, any ERC-20 token can be airdropped on Sablier. Add your
new token to the community sourced list for instant access, or test first using the token-address and onchain data.
