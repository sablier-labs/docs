# Airstreams

The Sablier Interface can handle more than native streams. We developed a solution for distributing token streams to
millions of users called **Airstreams**. Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com/airstreams/).

## Easy 3-step process

Create a campaign by following these three simple steps:

1. Configure the initial details (e.g., token, cancelability)
2. Upload the CSV containing a list of recipients
3. Deploy and fund the Airstream campaign contract

:::warning Timezone Caveat

All the dates and times in the CSV are considered to be in the same timezone as the locales of the airstream creator's
device.

:::info

With the official app, you can distribute up to 50k+ streams per campaign. If you'd like to support more, you can do so
by using a self-hosted [Merkle service](/api/merkle-api/intro). Feel free to get in touch for more details or premium
support.

## Support for any ERC-20 token

Stream your favorite token! Thanks to our integration of Token Lists, any ERC-20 token can be streamed on Sablier.

## Oversight

Have a clear view of how your campaign is performing. Check eligibility or manage your own campaign from a dedicated
interface.

To integrate this functionality into your own products/apps, have a look at the [API guides](/api/overview), especially
the [v2-merkle-api](/api/merkle-api/intro) and the merkle subgraphs.

## Advanced Settings

For campaign admins, the interface enables advanced settings like in-app visibility, in-app geographical restrictions,
and campaign-specific items like an eligibility criteria link.
