# Sablier Airstreams

The Sablier V2 interface includes much more than native streams support. We developed a solution at scale for
distributing token streams to millions called **Airstreams**. Start exploring at
[app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com).

## Easy 3-step process

Create a campaign by following these three simple steps:

1. Configure the initial details (e.g., token, cancelability)
2. Upload the CSV containing a list of recipients
3. Deploy and fund the airstream campaign contract

|                                              |                                                         |

:::warning Caveat about Date and Time

All the dates and times in the CSV are considered to be in the same timezone as the locales of the airstream creator's
device.

:::info

With the official app you can distribute up to 50k+ streams per campaign. If you'd like to support more, you can do so
by using a self-hosted [Merkle service](/api/merkle-api/intro). Feel free to get in touch for more details or premium
support.

## Dashboard for your airstreams

Enter the Dashboard and discover a detailed overview of airstreams you may be eligible for.

Take advantage of the Search functionality to explore the chain and gain more insight into how others are using Sablier.

## Support for any ERC-20 token

Stream your favorite token! Thanks to our integration of Token Lists, any ERC-20 token can be streamed on Sablier.

## Clear oversight

Have a clear view of how a campaign is performing. Check eligibility or manage your own campaign from a dedicated
interface.

To integrate this functionality into your own products/apps, have a look at the [API guides](/apis/overview), especially
the [v2-merkle-api](/api/merkle-api/intro) and the merkle subgraphs.
