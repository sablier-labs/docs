The Sablier Interface comes with many other smaller (but still cool) features, from aesthetic easter eggs to
integrations with popular services.

## Social Media Previews

For the socialites among our users, we've added a feature that generates social media preview images based on your
onchain activity in Sablier.

To see what your preview looks like, paste your stream URL (e.g. `app.sablier.com/stream/...`) on socials. Here's an
example:

![Stream Preview](/screenshots/stream-preview.webp)

## Farcaster Frames

![Farcaster Frame](/img/frame/farcaster.webp)

We created our https://x.com/razgraf/status/1779208294264955316! You can share these in your favorite Farcaster client
to interact directly with Sablier.

When pasted in the browser, the links will redirect to show the final images. Makes sure to use them in Farcaster in
this original form.
