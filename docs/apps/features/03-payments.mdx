The Sablier Interface will showcase [Flow](/concepts/flow/overview) streams under the Payments tab. These are token
streams with a no end-date, an ever increasing amount (can be topped up) and a flexible rate per second.

## Features

### Flexible terms

Increase the rate/second, fund the stream with more tokens and keep it alive indefinitely! With Flow streams in the
Payments tab you have the freedom to adapt your distribution schedule based on external KPIs, pivots or executive
decisions.

### Explore the dashboard

Enter the Dashboard and discover a detailed overview of your incoming and outgoing flow streams.

Take advantage of the Search functionality to explore the chain and gain more insight into how others are using Flow for
continuous payments, grants, salaries and more.

anyone really to increase transparency of your day to day token distribution.

### NFT representation

Each stream in wrapped in an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT), making the stream recipient the owner of the NFT.

Thus streams can be transferred, traded, and used as collateral in NFT lending protocols.

### Multi-chain experience

Streaming, everywhere. We enable payments on 11+ EVM chains and testnets where you can stream or get paid using Sablier.

### Create in batches

Save time by creating up to 60 streams in bulk for your employees, investors, or community members. Use the forms for a
clean and straightforward UX.

### Create from CSVs

Save even more time by using our CSV upload, dedicated to power-users. Under the hood, it works the same as the visual
forms.

### Safe multisig support

Payments are fully integrated with [Safe](https://safe.global). Start streaming from the safety and comfort of your
multisig wallet.

### Mobile-ready layout

Stream in style! Yes, the app works on mobile. And yes, we support dark mode by default (light mode coming soon).

### Permissions

We've mapped the most important utilities from the Flow contracts into in-app features. Interact with streams that
reference you as a key participant (e.g. sender, recipient) directly from the interfaces.
