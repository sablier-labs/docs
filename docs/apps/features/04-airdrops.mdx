# Airdrops

The Sablier Interface can handle more than native streams. We developed a solution for distributing token streams to
millions of users called **Airdrops**. Start exploring at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com/airdrops/) or read
more about it on [sablier.com/airdrops](https://sablier.com/airdrops).

:::note

Airdrops allow for millions of recipients to receive an allocation. To see how they differ from
[group streams](/apps/features/vesting#create-in-batches) (~60 streams at once) read our [FAQ](/support/faq).

**Airdrops should be vested!**

Here at Sablier we believe in long-term distributions that align incentives. That's why we engineered Airstreams, a
solution which allows you to airdrop streams to a very large number of recipients.

Pick a vesting curve (e.g. linear or stepper), define the rules (e.g. duration, clawback window) and allow recipients to
claim their allocations as streams.

## Instant Airdrops

For communities that are still looking to distribute value quickly and efficiently, Sablier offers a one-time instant
airdrop solution. This facilitates and easy onboarding of millions of users into the campaign creator's ecosystem, while
exposing everyone to the amazing features our products can offer.

## Features

### Create from CSVs

Pre-generate the list of recipients and drop the file right into our app. We sanitize, validate and triple-check the
data to ensure everything is formatted correctly.

:::caution Timezone Caveat

All the dates and times in the CSV are considered to be in the same timezone as the locales of the airstream creator's
device. Visit out [Guide for CSV Support](/apps/guides/csv-support) to read about timezones, date or amount formats and
more.

### Easy 3-step process

Create a campaign by following these three simple steps:

1. Configure the initial details (e.g., token, cancelability)
2. Upload the CSV containing a list of recipients
3. Deploy and fund the Airstream campaign contract (can be funded later)

### Public source

You can distribute a large number of streams per campaign through our app. If you'd like to support Airdrops in your own
UI or have additional requirements, you can do so by using a self-hosted
[Merkle service](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/overview). Feel free to get in touch for more details or premium support.

### Explore the dashboard

Enter the Dashboard and discover a detailed overview of the Airdrops you may be eligible for.

Take advantage of the Search functionality to explore the chain and gain more insight into how others are using Sablier.

### Support for any ERC-20 token

Drop your own token! Thanks to our integration of Token Lists, any ERC-20 token can be airdropped on Sablier. Add your
new token to the community sourced list for instant access, or test first using the token-address and onchain data.

To integrate this functionality into your own products/apps, have a look at the [API guides](/api/overview), especially
the [v2-merkle-api](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/overview) and the Merkle subgraphs.

### Advanced Settings

For campaign admins, the interface enables advanced settings like in-app visibility, in-app geographical restrictions,
and campaign-specific items like an eligibility criteria link.

### Geographical Restrictions

As shown in the image above, you can specify a list of countries where access to the campaign will be restricted on the
Sablier Interface at [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com). Note that this restriction does not apply to the
Sablier Protocol, which runs permissionlessly on the blockchain.

Additionally, some jurisdictions may already be restricted by our hosting provider or your ISP by default.
