### Where can I access the Sablier protocol?

You can access Sablier through the following web interfaces:

app.sablier.com app.safe.global (if you are using a Safe multisig wallet)

### What is real-time finance?

A term coined by us to emphasize the wide-ranging use cases for the Sablier protocol. We like to think about work as an
attempt to rethink the way trust is established in financial contracts.

### What is token streaming?

An alternative wording, coined by Andreas Antonopoulos in 2017. Just like you can stream movies on Netflix or music on
Spotify, so you can stream tokens by the second on Sablier.

### How does streaming work on Sablier?

Imagine Alice wants to make a 3,000 DAI payment to Bob during the whole month of January.

1. Alice deposits the 3,000 DAI in Sablier before Jan 1, setting the stop time to Feb 1.
2. Bob's crypto earnings increase every second beginning Jan 1.
3. On Jan 10, Bob will have earned approximately 1,000 DAI.
4. If at any point during January Alice wishes to recover her tokens, she can cancel the stream and recover what has not
   been streamed yet.

### How can I create a stream?

You will need an EVM wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me), etc.), some ETH (or the
network's token to pay gas fees) and an ERC-20 token like DAI. Then, choose your favorite interface for accessing the
Sablier protocol (such as app.sablier.com) and fill in the recipient's address, the deposit amount and the total
duration.

Alternatively, you can see [here](/contracts/v2/guides/etherscan) how to manually create a stream using
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io).

### How does streaming work?

Dividing the deposit amount by the difference between the stop time and the start time gives us a payment rate per
second. Sablier uses this rate to transfer a small portion of tokens from the sender to the recipient once every second.

For instance, if the payment rate was 0.01 DAI per second, the recipient would receive:

0.01 _ 60 = 0.6 DAI / minute 0.01 _ 60 _ 60 = 36 DAI / hour 0.01 _ 60 _ 60 _ 24 = 864 DAI / day

### Where are the tokens held?

In our smart contracts. You can verify this assertion by inspecting Etherscan or any other blockchain explorer.

### How can recipients access their tokens?

As the tokens are being streamed at the smart contract level, recipients can consider Sablier their real-time wallet for
digital currency.

To make withdrawals, recipients can:

1. Use a web interface (e.g. app.sablier.com).
2. Call the contract directly on a blockchain explorer.

### Can I cancel streams?

Yes, both as a sender and a recipient.

If the stream is canceled before the start time, the whole deposit amount is returned in full to you. If the stream is
canceled while the stream is active, the smart contracts calculate how much has been streamed, transfer that to the
recipient and return the remainder to you. If the stream is canceled after the stream has stopped, the smart contracts
transfers all the remaining funds (if any) to the recipient.

### Can I modify the streaming rate?

No. Once a stream is created, it is set in stone on the Ethereum blockchain.

In a future version of the Sablier protocol, we may add the option to refill an active stream and even extend it.
