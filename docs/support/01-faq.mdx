### Where can I access the Sablier protocols?

You can access Sablier through the following web interfaces:

- [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com)
- [app.safe.global](https://app.safe.global) (if you are using a Safe multisig wallet)

### What is real-time finance?

A term coined by us to emphasize the wide-ranging use cases for the Lockup protocol. We like to think about work as an
attempt to rethink the way trust is established in financial contracts.

### What is token streaming?

An alternative wording, coined by Andreas Antonopoulos in 2017. Just like you can stream movies on Netflix or music on
Spotify, so you can stream tokens by the second on Sablier.

### How does streaming work on Sablier Lockup?

Imagine Alice wants to stream 3,000 DAI to Bob during the whole month of January.

1. Alice deposits the 3,000 DAI in Lockup before Jan 1, setting the end time to Feb 1.
2. Bob's allocation of the DAI deposit increases every second beginning Jan 1.
3. On Jan 10, Bob will have earned approximately 1,000 DAI. He can send a transaction to Lockup to withdraw the tokens.
4. If at any point during January Alice wishes to get back her tokens, she can cancel the stream and recover what has
   not been streamed yet.

### How does streaming work on Sablier Flow?

Coming soon.

### How can I create a stream?

You will need an EVM wallet ([Metamask](https://metamask.io), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me), etc.), some ETH (or the
network's token to pay gas fees) and an ERC-20 token like DAI. Then, choose your favorite interface for accessing the
Sablier protocols (such as [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com)) and fill in the recipient's address, the deposit
amount and the total duration.

Alternatively, you can see [here](/guides/lockup/examples/etherscan) how to manually create a stream using
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io).

### How does Lockup streaming work?

Dividing the deposit amount by the difference between the stop time and the start time gives us a payment rate per
second. Lockup uses this rate to transfer a small portion of tokens from the sender to the recipient once every second.

For instance, if the payment rate was 0.01 DAI per second, the recipient would receive:

$0.01 * 60 = 0.6$ DAI / minute, $0.01 * 60 * 60 = 36$ DAI / hour, $0.01 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 864$ DAI / day

### Where are the tokens held?

In our smart contracts. You can verify this assertion by inspecting Etherscan or any other blockchain explorer.

### How can recipients access their tokens?

As the tokens are being streamed at the smart contract level, recipients can consider Sablier their real-time wallet for
digital currency.

To make withdrawals, recipients can:

1. Use a web interface (e.g. [app.sablier.com](https://app.sablier.com)).
2. Call the contract directly on a blockchain explorer.

### Can I cancel streams?

Yes, both as a sender and a recipient.

If the stream is canceled before the start time, the whole deposit amount is returned in full to you. If the stream is
canceled while the stream is active, the smart contracts calculate how much has been streamed, transfer that to the
recipient and return the remainder to you. If the stream is canceled after the stream has stopped, the smart contracts
transfers all the remaining funds (if any) to the recipient.

### Can I modify the streaming rate?

On Lockup, once a stream is created, it is set in stone on the Ethereum blockchain. Whereas on Flow, a stream rate per
second can be modified anytime by the creator.

### How are Drops (Airstreams) different than a group of normal streams?

Creating streams through our forms (manual or CSV) will physically start those streams onchain, on the spot. This means
you click to create a transaction, pay for the gas, and start all the streams for your recipients.

Due to how block memory works (specifically the gas limit) you can only fit a limited number of streams (usually 60) in
a single block before running out of space. This is great for small distributions like paying your contractors or a set
of investors.

Meanwhile, Drops (Instant or Airstreams) leverage a "lazy creation" of streams. You deploy a contract that stores a list
of recipients and the streams they are entitles to claim. Every recipient will manually click to claim their allocation
and create their stream **only in that moment**. This allows for millions of recipients to be defined at once, with them
triggering the stream creation one after the other (as opposed to all at once).

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Number of streams              | ~60 (depends on gas limit) | Millions                     |
| Gas to create streams          | Sender paying              | Recipient paying             |
| Gas to deploy "Drops" contract | N/A                        | Sender paying                |
| Streams show up onchain        | On the spot (all at once)  | Lazily (one after the other) |
