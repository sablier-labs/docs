### Focus On Vesting

**Sablier v2** is the latest version of our **battle-tested streaming protocol**, and it features a specific focus on vesting. Over the years, we have been fortunate to see the protocol reaching product/market-fit with token-vesting and airdrops.

The **user experience has been massively improved**, **the feature set which the protocol offers has been massively expanded**, and **the overall quality of the product is truly unmatched**.

### Streaming Curves

While Sablier v1 only allowed linear streaming curves, and didn't offer native support for cliffs, this all changes with v2.

**Sablier v2 offers excellent native support for cliffs and other types of streaming curves** such as exponentials, logarithms and many other mathematical functions.

An **exponential stream** allows you to stream exponentially more as time moves forward. A **logarithmic stream** will stream the majority of the funds initially while progressively slowing down until it reaches a sort of plateau.

You just want a traditional vesting schedule with monthly/quarterly/yearly unlocks? That's also possible!

**v2 is to streaming what Ethereum is to smart contracts:** just like any type of smart contract can be created on Ethereum, any type of stream can be created using Sablier.

### Uncancellable Streams & NFTs

Sablier v2 offers the ability to create **uncancellable streams**, giving even more control to the end user and enabling a large series of new use cases.

In v2, **every stream is also represented by an NFT**, enabling the ability to borrow against a stream in a compatible NFT lending protocol.

A DAO contributor receiving their compensation through Sablier could theoretically borrow against the stream to have rapid access to cash if need be.

Another use case might be investors receiving vested tokens streamed through Sablier, they are now able to borrow against the stream to access additionnal capital.

### Sleek Interface

**Sablier v2 comes with a brand new interface, with an even better user experience**. Here are a few bullet points covering what's new:

1. **An even better multi-chain experience**
2. The streaming dashboard now features **a brand new and amazingly useful search utility for all-things-streaming**
3. **Custom stream creation** - v2 brings the cliff, as well as pro streams with custom curves such as exponentials, logarithms...
4. **The new interface is even more permissionless**: anyone can now use a custom token in the app without requiring a manual listing
5. **The tech stack has seen incredible improvements** that make the app **amazingly fast**
6. We have introduced **a new and elegant design system to make our design language even better**
