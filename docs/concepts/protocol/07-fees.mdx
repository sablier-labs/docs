There are two types of fees in Sablier: broker fees and protocol fees. Both are charged when a stream is created. In the
event of an early stream cancellation, the fees are not refunded.

## Broker fees

In the Sablier ecosystem, a "broker" is any third-party entity that interacts with the Sablier Protocol on behalf of
other users. These brokers have the ability to charge service fees for facilitating such interactions.

Broker fees are particularly useful for front-end applications that integrate the Sablier Protocol. They enable
front-end operators to levy a fee on each Sablier stream created through their platform.

The broker fee is a percentage of the streamed amount, and it cannot be higher than 10%.

:::note

The official [Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com) does not currently charge any broker fees.

## Protocol Fees

The Sablier Protocol features a fee parameter that the [Protocol Admin](/concepts/governance) can enable for specific
ERC-20 assets.

Just like broker fees, the protocol fee is charged as a percentage of the streamed amount (not a flat rate). The
difference is that this fee applies globally to all streams created with a particular ERC-20 asset, regardless of the
stream creation method â€” be it through the Sablier Interface or a third-party front-end application integrating the
Sablier Protocol.

The Admin has the ability to modify the protocol fee for individual ERC-20 assets; however, no fee can exceed the
hard-coded limit of 10%.

:::note

The protocol fee is currently set to 0% for all ERC-20 assets.

## Gas Fees

### Q: What are gas fees?

A: [Gas fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain
validators in native tokens such as ETH. Sablier Labs does not take any cut from this.

### Q: When are gas fees paid?

A: Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. It does not accrue in real-time.

### Q: Does Sablier receive any portion of the gas fee?

A: No. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.
