The Sablier Protocol wraps every stream in an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT), making the stream recipient the owner of
the NFT. The recipient can transfer the NFT to another address, and this also transfers the right to withdraw funds from
the stream, including any funds already streamed.

## Integrations

The transferability of the NFT makes Sablier streams tradable and usable as collateral in DeFi. Imagine an NFT lending
marketplace that allows users to borrow funds by locking their streams as collateral (effectively borrowing against
their future income). Or a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade streams for other assets.

:::note

Not all Sablier streams are transferable. The stream creator can choose to make the stream
[non-transferable](/contracts/v2/guides/stream-management/transfer).

and we will try to respond as soon as possible.

## Marketplaces

Thanks to adhering to the ERC-721 standard, Sablier streams can be traded and viewed on any NFT marketplace. Here are
some of the marketplaces that support Sablier streams:

- [OpenSea](https://opensea.io)
- [Blur](https://blur.io)
- [Rarible](https://rarible.com)
- [SuperRare](https://superrare.com)
- [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org)

If you prefer the granularity of a blockchain explorer, you can also view the stream NFTs on
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xB10daee1FCF62243aE27776D7a92D39dC8740f95). See the
[Deployments](/contracts/v2/deployments) page for the full list of addresses.

### Caching

The SVG artwork is generated using certain real-time values, such as the current time on the blockchain. However, NFT
marketplaces cache the NFT metadata, and this may cause the SVGs might not always be up to date.

The Sablier Protocol triggers [ERC-4906](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4906) events whenever there's an update in a
stream (for instance, when a withdrawal is made). However, it's worth noting that some streams might remain unchanged
for an extended period.

To ensure you're viewing the most recent version of the NFT SVG, it's recommended to check the stream directly via the
[Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com).

## Hourglass SVG

Similar to Uniswap V3 Positions, Sablier V2 Streams are represented as unique on-chain generated hourglass SVGs, which
change their color and content based on user data. Here's an example for a stream that is 42.35% way through:

<NFTSVG height={500} width={500} />

## Gallery of Hourglass SVGs

Here's a gallery with multiple Sablier NFT SVGs:
