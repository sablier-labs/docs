## Merkle Distributor

At the core of an airdrop, the concept that allows distributing tokens to a large number of recipients in an efficient
and secure manner is called _Merkle Distributor_. Fundamental to this system is the Merkle Tree, a data structure used
for efficiently summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data.

## Airstream Campaigns

The word "Airstream" is a portmanteau of "airdrop" and "stream". This is an airdrop model where the tokens are
distributed over time, as opposed to all at once.

Sablier inovated by combing the _Merkle Distributor_ with the concept of streaming and we call them _Airstream
Campaigns_, which lets user claim Sablier streams using Merkle proofs. An Airstream Campaign is an unique smart
contract, that anyone can configure and deploy through the [Sablier UI](https://app.sablier.com/airstreams). Each
campaign has an unique and secure tree of recipients and their respective shares of the total amount of tokens to be
distributed. Another aspect of the campaign is that it can be configured to either have a claim period window or no
expiration.

The contract that implements an Airstream Campaign is called `MerkleStreamer`. For those interested in the technical
part, [click here](/contracts/v2/reference/periphery/contract.SablierV2MerkleStreamerLL).
