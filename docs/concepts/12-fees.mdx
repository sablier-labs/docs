During the course of using Sablier, you may encounter up to three different types of fees:
[Interface Fees](#interface-fees), [Contract Fees](#contract-fees), and [Gas Fees](#gas-fees). Below you can see a
breakdown of how each fee is calculated and who receives it.

## Interface Fees

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee in USD for certain operations. However, this fee is paid in the native gas
token, i.e. in ETH for streams on Ethereum, and in POL for streams on Polygon.

The fee amount is calculated based on market prices. For example, when ETH is \$4000, a \$1 fee is 0.00025 ETH.

:::tip[For Senders]

Interface Fees can be subsidized - the person creating the stream or airdrop can choose to cover the fees that would
normally be charged to recipients.

If you're interested in subsiding fees for your users, please <Link href={Links.Forms.CALL}>contact us</Link> to discuss
your specific requirements.

:::

### Stream Withdrawals

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee each time you withdraw from a stream. This applies to both Lockup and Flow
streams.

:::info[How much is the withdraw fee?]

The fee is **$1** (in the gas token) regardless of the withdraw amount.

:::

The fee applies only to streams created via [Lockup v2.0 (or later)](/guides/lockup/deployments#versions) and
[Flow v1.1 (or later)](/guides/flow/deployments#versions). You do not pay this fee for withdrawing from streams created
using earlier releases.

### Airdrop Claims

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee when you claim an airdrop.

:::info[How much is the claim fee?]

The fee is **$2** (in the gas token) per claim, regardless of the airdrop amount.

:::

The fee applies only to airdrops created via Merkle [Airdrops v1.3 (or later)](/guides/airdrops/deployments#versions).
Claims from airdrops created with earlier versions do not incur any claim fee.

### Timeline for Interface Fees

| Product  | Timeline                   | Operation     | Fee |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | --- |
| Airdrops | Apr 10, 2025 - present     | Airdrop claim | \$2 |
| Lockup   | Feb 3, 2025 - present      | Withdraw      | \$1 |
| Flow     | Feb 3, 2025 - present      | Withdraw      | \$1 |
| Airdrops | Feb 3, 2025 - Apr 10, 2025 | Airdrop claim | \$3 |
| Airdrops | Dec 18, 2023 - Feb 2, 2025 | Airdrop claim | 0   |
| Lockup   | Jul 3, 2023 - Feb 2, 2025  | Withdraw      | 0   |
| Flow     | Dec 4, 2024 - Feb 2, 2025  | Withdraw      | 0   |

## Contract Fees

As opposed to the Interface Fees, the Contract Fees are charged by the Sablier contracts themselves. They apply
regardless of the interface used to interact with the Sablier Protocol.

This fee is also charged in USD but paid in the native gas token via the
[`msg.value`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.30/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties)
field of the transaction. During a transaction, [Chainlink](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles) is used to
convert the fee from USD to the native gas token. The transaction succeeds only if the `msg.value` is greater than or
equal to the fee amount returned by `calculateMinFeeWei` function which is available in
[Lockup](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.SablierLockup.md#calculateminfeewei),
[Flow](/reference/flow/contracts/contract.SablierFlow.md#calculateminfeewei) and
[Airdrops](/reference/airdrops/contracts/abstracts/abstract.SablierMerkleBase.md#calculateminfeewei) contracts.

:::tip[For Senders]

Contract Fees can be subsidized - the person creating the stream or airdrop can choose to cover the fees that would
normally be charged to recipients.

your specific requirements.

:::

The [Comptroller](/concepts/governance/#comptroller) can update the Contract Fees.

- In case of Lockup and Flow, the new fee would apply to all the new streams created after the update, as well as the
  existing streams.
- In case of Airdrops, the new fee would apply to all the new airdrops campaigns created after the update. The fee on
  the existing airdrops campaigns remains the same or can be LOWERED if subsidized by the campaign owners.

:::warning

The Contract Fee acts as a **minimum fee**, so it is NOT cumulative with the Interface Fee. When you interact with the
contracts via Sablier interface, you only pay the Interface Fee. On the other hand, if you interact with the contract
directly, you will only pay the Contract Fee.

:::

### Stream Withdrawals

Lockup and Flow contracts charge a flat fee each time you withdraw from a stream.

On the chains listed below, the fee is **$0.9** (in the gas token). For the chains NOT listed below, it is zero.

The Contract Fee applies only to airdrop campaigns created with
[Merkle Airdrops v2.0 (or later)](/guides/airdrops/deployments#versions).

#### Merkle Airdrops v1.3

In [Merkle Airdrops v1.3](/guides/airdrops/previous-deployments/v1.3), oracles were not used. As a result, the fees in
v1.3 are specified in the native token. Therefore, the fees in the table above are applicable only to v2.0 and later.
For v1.3, the fees are as follows:

## Gas Fees

[Gas fees](https://investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain validators in
the native token of the network, e.g., ETH for Ethereum Mainnet.

Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. Gas does not accrue in real-time.

Importantly, Sablier Labs does not take any cut from the gas fee. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain network
validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.

## Fee Subsidization

Interface and Contract Fees can be subsidized, partially or fully, by the sender in certain cases. This means that the
person creating the stream or airdrop can choose to cover the fees that would normally be charged to the recipient. Note
that the gas fees cannot be subsidized as they are paid to the blockchain network validators on every transaction.

If you're interested in subsiding fees for your users, please

discuss your specific requirements.

## FAQ

### Q: How are the Interface Fees charged?

**A:** They are added to the gas fee. For example, if the gas fee is \$10 and the Interface Fee is \$1, you would pay
\$11 in total (the payment is taken in the gas token, e.g., ETH).

### Q: Are the Interface Fees and the Contract Fees cumulative?

**A:** No. The Contract Fee acts as a **minimum fee**, so it will not get added to the Interface Fee. You will pay the
higher of the two fees.

### Q: Does the Stream Withdrawal Fee apply to each withdrawal?

**A:** Yes, unless they are subsidized by the sender. The fee is charged each time you withdraw from a stream. For
example, if you withdraw from a stream 10 times, you will pay $10 in fees.

### Q: Can the Interface Fees and the Contract Fees be subsidized?

**A:** Yes, they can be subsidized by the stream sender or the airdrop creator. Please
