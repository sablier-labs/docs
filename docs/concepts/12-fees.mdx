During the course of using Sablier, you may encounter up to three different types of fees:
[Interface Fees](#interface-fees), [Contract Fees](#contract-fees), and [Gas Fees](#gas-fees). Each of these fees may go
to a different party. Below you can see a breakdown of how each fee is calculated and who receives it.

## Interface Fees

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee for certain operations. This fee is paid in the native gas token, i.e. in ETH
for streams on Ethereum, and in POL for streams on Polygon.

The fee amount is calculated based on market prices. For example, when ETH is \$4000, a \$1 fee is 0.00025 ETH.

:::tip[For Senders]

Interface Fees can be subsidized - the person creating the stream or airdrop can choose to cover the fees that would
normally be charged to recipients.

your specific requirements.

### Stream Withdrawals

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee each time you withdraw from a stream. This applies to both Lockup and Flow
streams.

:::info[What is the withdraw fee?]

The fee is **$1** (in the gas token) regardless of the withdraw amount.

:::

The fee applies only to streams created via Lockup v2.0 (or later) and Flow v1.1 (or later). You do not pay this fee for
withdrawing from streams created using earlier releases.

### Airdrop Claims

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee when you claim an airdrop.

:::info[What is the claim fee?]

The fee is **$2** (in the gas token) per claim, regardless of the airdrop amount.

:::

The fee applies only to airdrops created via Merkle Airdrops v1.3 (or later). Claims from airdrops created with earlier
versions do not incur any claim fee.

### Timeline for Interface Fees

| Product  | Timeline                   | Operation     | Fee |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | --- |
| Airdrops | Apr 10, 2025 - present     | Airdrop claim | \$2 |
| Lockup   | Feb 3, 2025 - present      | Withdraw      | \$1 |
| Flow     | Feb 3, 2025 - present      | Withdraw      | \$1 |
| Airdrops | Feb 3, 2025 - Apr 10, 2025 | Airdrop claim | \$3 |
| Airdrops | Dec 18, 2023 - Feb 2, 2025 | Airdrop claim | 0   |
| Lockup   | Jul 3, 2023 - Feb 2, 2025  | Withdraw      | 0   |
| Flow     | Dec 4, 2024 - Feb 2, 2025  | Withdraw      | 0   |

## Contract Fees

As opposed to the Interface fees, the contract fees are charged by the Sablier contracts themselves. They apply
regardless of the interface used to interact with the Sablier Protocol.

This fee is charged via the `msg.value` field. Basically, for the contract to accept a transaction, the `msg.value` must
be greater than or equal to the fee.

:::warning

The Contract Fee acts as a **minimum fee**, so it is NOT cumulative with the Interface Fee. You will pay the higher of
the two fees.

:::

### MerkleFactory

The ONLY contracts that can charge fees in Sablier are the `MerkleFactory` contract and the airdrop contracts it
deploys.

The [Protocol Admin](/concepts/governance/) can update the fee in the Merkle Factories contract. However, the new fee
applies only to airdrops created after the update. The fee values in the individual airdrop contracts remain immutable
once set.

Like the Interface fee, this fee is paid in the native gas token, e.g., ETH on Ethereum, POL on Polygon.

The fee can only be applied to airdrops created with [Merkle Airdrops v1.3](/guides/airdrops/deployments) (or later).
Airdrop campaigns created with earlier versions do not incur any claim fee.

:::info[What is the fee?]

The fee is ~**$1** (in the gas token) per claim, regardless of the airdrop amount.

## Gas Fees

[Gas fees](https://investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain validators in
the native token of the network, e.g., ETH for Ethereum Mainnet.

Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. Gas does not accrue in real-time.

Importantly, Sablier Labs does not take any cut from the gas fee. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain network
validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.

## Fee Subsidization

Interface and contract fees can be subsidized, partially or fully, by the sender in certain cases. This means that the
person creating the stream or airdrop can choose to cover the fees that would normally be charged to the recipient. Note
that the gas fees cannot be subsidized as they are paid to the blockchain network validators on every transaction.

## FAQ

### Q: How are the Interface Fees charged?

A: They are added to the gas fee. For example, if the gas fee is \$10 and the Interface Fee is \$1, you would pay \$11
in total (the payment is taken in the gas token, e.g., ETH).

### Q: Are the Interface Fees and the Contract Fees cumulative?

A: No. The Contract Fee acts as a **minimum fee**, so it will not get added to the Interface Fee. You will pay the
higher of the two fees.

### Q: Does the Stream Withdrawal Fee apply to each withdrawal?

A: Yes, unless they are subsidized by the sender. The fee is charged each time you withdraw from a stream. For example,
if you withdraw from a stream 10 times, you will pay $10 in fees.

### Q: Can the Interface Fees and the Contract Fees be subsidized?

A: Yes, they can be subsidized by the stream sender or the airdrop creator. Please
