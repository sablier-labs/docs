## UI Fee

UI fee is the fee charged by the Sablier interface when you do certain operations such as withdraw from streams or claim
an airdrop.

### Streams

Sablier interface charges a fixed fee when you withdraw from a stream. This applies to both Lockup and Flow.

:::tip[What is the withdraw fee in UI?]

It is currently fixed at **$1 per withdrawal**, regardless of the withdraw amount. The fee is paid in the native token,
i.e. you would pay in POL for streams on Polygon network, and in ETH for streams on Ethereum network.

:::

The UI fee applies only to Lockup v2.0 and Flow v1.1. You do not pay the UI fee for withdrawing from streams created
using earlier releases.

### Airdrops

Sablier interface charges a fixed fee when you claim from an airdrop campaign.

:::tip[What is the Claim Fee in UI?]

This fee is currently fixed at $3 per claim, irrespective of the claim amount. The fee is paid in the native token.

:::

The UI fee applies only to Merkle Airdrops v1.3. Campaigns created with earlier versions do not incur claim fee.

## Contract Fee

Contract fee is the fee charged by the smart contract to perform certain operations.

### Merkle Airdrops

Contract fee is ONLY implemented in the Merkle Airdrop contract for claiming an airdrop, however, its value is set to 0.

Protocol admin has the ability to change this fee in the contract. Once set, this fee will only apply to the campaigns
created after the fee change timestamp. Similar to the UI fees, this fee will also be paid in the native token, i.e. you
would pay in POL for streams on Polygon network, and in ETH for streams on Ethereum network

:::tip[What is the claim fee in Contract?]

It is 0.

:::

The claim fee applies only to Merkle Airdrops v1.3. Campaigns created with earlier versions do not incur claim fee.

## Gas Fee

### Q: What are gas fees?

A: [Gas fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain
validators in native tokens such as ETH. Sablier Labs does not take any cut from this.

### Q: When are gas fees paid?

A: Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. It does not accrue in real-time.

### Q: Does Sablier receive any portion of the gas fee?

A: No. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.

To find out how much gas each function costs, you can see the gas benchmark reports of
[Lockup](/guides/lockup/gas-benchmarks) and [Flow](/guides/flow/gas-benchmarks).
