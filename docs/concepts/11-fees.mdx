## Interface Fees

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee for certain operations. This fee is paid in the native gas token, i.e. in ETH
for streams on Ethereum, and in POL for streams on Polygon.

### Stream Withdrawals

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee when you withdraw from a stream. This applies to both Lockup and Flow streams.

:::tip[What is the withdraw fee?]

The fee is **$1** (in the gas token) regardless of the withdraw amount.

:::

The fee applies only to streams created via Lockup v2.0 (or later) and Flow v1.1 (or later). You do not pay this fee for
withdrawing from streams created using earlier releases.

### Airdrop Claims

The Sablier Interface charges a flat fee when you claim an airdrop.

:::tip[What is the claim fee?]

The fee is **$3** (in the gas token) per claim, regardless of the airdrop amount.

:::

The fee applies only to airdrops created via Merkle Airdrops v1.3 (or later). Claims from airdrops created with earlier
versions do not incur any claim fee.

## Contract Fees

As opposed to the Interface fees, the contract fees are charged by the Sablier contracts themselves. They would apply
regardless of the interface used to interact with the Sablier Protocol.

### MerkleFactory

The ONLY contracts that can charge fees in Sablier are the `MerkleFactory` contract and the airdrop contracts it
deploys.

The [protocol admin](/concepts/governance/) can update the fee in the
[`MerkleFactory`](/reference/airdrops/contracts/contract.SablierMerkleFactory) contract. However, the new fee
applies only to airdrops created after the update. The fee values in the individual airdrop contracts remain immutable
once set.

Like the Interface fee, this fee is paid in the native gas token, e.g., ETH on Ethereum, POL on Polygon.

:::tip[What is the contract fee?]

It is currently set to 0.

:::

The fee can only be applied to airdrops created with Merkle Airdrops v1.3 (or later). Airdrops created with earlier
versions do not incur any claim fee.

## Gas Fee

### Q: How are the Interface fees charged?

A: They are added to the gas fee. For example, if the gas fee is \$10 and the Interface fee is \$1, you would pay \$11
in total (the payment is taken in the gas token, e.g., ETH).

### Q: What are gas fees?

A: [Gas fees](https://investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain validators
in the gas token of the network, e.g., ETH. Sablier Labs does not take any cut from this.

### Q: When are gas fees paid?

A: Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. Gas is not accrued in real-time.

### Q: Does Sablier receive any portion of the gas fee?

A: No. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain network validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.
