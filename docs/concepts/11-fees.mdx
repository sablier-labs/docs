There are two types of fees in the Sablier ecosystem: **Protocol Fee** and **Broker Fee**.

## Protocol fee

This is a fee that can be charged at the protocol level, capped at 10%. Only the protocol admin has the authority to
change it.

### Lockup

Lockup doesn't implement protocol fees.

### Flow

While Flow has the ability to charge a protocol fee, no fee is set at the moment. If a fee is introduced in the future,
users will be notified in advance. When active, the fee will be deducted as a percentage from the withdrawn amount.

## Broker fee

A "broker" is any third-party entity that interacts with the Sablier Protocol on behalf of other users. These brokers
have the ability to charge service fees for facilitating such interactions.

Broker fees are particularly useful for front-end applications that integrate the Sablier Protocol. They enable
front-end operators to levy a fee on each interaction facilitated through their platform.

### Lockup

The broker fee can be charged as a percentage of the streamed amount, and it cannot be higher than 10%. In the event of
cancellation, broker fee is non-refundable.

### Flow

The broker fee can be charged as a percentage of the deposit amount, and it cannot be higher than 10%. In case of
refund, broker fee is non-refundable.

:::info

The official [Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com) does NOT currently charge any broker fees.

## Gas Fees

### Q: What are gas fees?

A: [Gas fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain
validators in native tokens such as ETH. Sablier Labs does not take any cut from this.

### Q: When are gas fees paid?

A: Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. It does not accrue in real-time.

### Q: Does Sablier receive any portion of the gas fee?

A: No. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.
