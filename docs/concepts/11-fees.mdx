## Lockup

### Withdraw Fee

The withdraw fee is the fee a stream recipient pays to the Sablier UI to withdraw from a Lockup stream. This fee is
charged by the Sablier UI and is not enforced at the contract level.

:::tip[How much is the Withdraw Fee?]

It is currently fixed at **$1 per withdrawal**, regardless of the withdrawal amount. The fee is paid in the native
token, i.e. you would pay in POL for streams on Polygon network, and in ETH for streams on Ethereum network.

:::

The withdraw fee applies only to Lockup v2.0. Streams created using earlier Lockup releases do not pay withdrawal fees.

### Broker Fee

A "broker" is any third-party entity that interacts with the Sablier Protocol on behalf of other users. These brokers
have the ability to charge service fees for facilitating such interactions.

Broker fees are particularly useful for front-end applications that integrate the Sablier Protocol. They enable
front-end operators to levy a fee on each interaction facilitated through their platform.

The broker fee can be charged as a percentage of the streamed amount, and it cannot be higher than 10%. In the event of
cancellation, broker fee is non-refundable.

:::info

The official [Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com) does NOT currently charge any broker fees.

## Merkle Airdrops

### Claim Fee

The claim fee is the fee paid by eligible recipients to the Merkle Airdrop protocol to claim an airdrop. This fee can be
enforced at the contract level and would require recipients to pay a minimum of fee set in order to claim. Only the
protocol admin has the authority to change it.

Similar to Lockup's withdraw fee, this fee is also paid in the native token, i.e. you would pay in POL for streams on
Polygon network, and in ETH for streams on Ethereum network.

:::tip[How much is the Claim Fee?]

This fee is currently fixed at $3 per claim, irrespective of the claim amount. The fee is paid in the native token.

:::

The claim fee applies only to Merkle Airdrops v1.3. Campaigns created with earlier versions do not incur claim fee.

## Flow

### Withdraw Fee

Similar to Lockup protocol, Flow protocol also has the withdraw fee i.e. the fee a stream recipient pays to the Sablier
UI to withdraw from a Flow stream. This fee is charged by the Sablier UI and is not enforced at the contract level.

:::tip[How much is the Withdraw Fee?]

It is currently fixed at **$1 per withdrawal**, regardless of the withdrawal amount. The fee is paid in the native
token, i.e. you would pay in POL for streams on Polygon network, and in ETH for streams on Ethereum network.

:::

The withdraw fee applies only to Flow v1.1. Streams created using earlier Flow releases do not pay withdrawal fees.

### Protocol Fee

This is a fee that can be charged at the protocol level, capped at 10%. Only the protocol admin has the authority to
change it.

While Flow has the ability to charge a protocol fee, no fee is set at the moment. If a fee is introduced in the future,
users will be notified in advance. When active, the fee will be deducted as a percentage from the withdrawn amount.

:::info

There is NO protocol fee enabled at the moment.

Similar to Lockup Protocol, the official [Sablier Interface](https://app.sablier.com) does NOT currently charge any
broker fees.

## Gas Fee

### Q: What are gas fees?

A: [Gas fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) are transaction fees paid to the blockchain
validators in native tokens such as ETH. Sablier Labs does not take any cut from this.

### Q: When are gas fees paid?

A: Gas is paid only when streams are created, canceled, transferred, or withdrawn from. It does not accrue in real-time.

### Q: Does Sablier receive any portion of the gas fee?

A: No. 100% of the gas fee goes to the blockchain validators, which are not affiliated with Sablier Labs.

:::tip

To find out how much gas each function costs, you can see the gas benchmark reports of
[Lockup](/guides/lockup/gas-benchmarks) and [Flow](/guides/flow/gas-benchmarks).
