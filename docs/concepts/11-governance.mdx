## Comptroller

The Sablier Comptroller is a smart contract that acts as an intermediary between the protocols and the admin. It has
exclusive access to specific protocol functions. This design provides a more flexible approach to access control across
all protocols while maintaining security.

Admin addresses that control the Comptroller are listed in the [Admin Addresses](#admin-addresses) section.

## Lockup

Comptroller has the following permissions on each chain where `Lockup` is deployed:

| Permission         | Function           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Allow to Hook      | `allowToHook`      |
| Recover            | `recover`          |
| Set Native Token   | `setNativeToken`   |
| Set NFT Descriptor | `setNFTDescriptor` |

## Merkle Factory

Comptroller has the following permission on each chain where the Merkle Factories are deployed:

| Permission       | Function         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Set Native Token | `setNativeToken` |

## Flow

Comptroller has the following permissions on each chain where `Flow` is deployed:

| Permission         | Function           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Recover            | `recover`          |
| Set Native Token   | `setNativeToken`   |
| Set NFT Descriptor | `setNFTDescriptor` |

## Admin Addresses

The Comptroller is introduced in Lockup v3.0, Airdrops v2.0 and Flow v2.0. For earlier versions, we use a direct "Admin"
role for governance. These admin accounts have the same authority as the current Comptroller contract, with direct
access to specific protocol functions. More concretely, the Admin is a collection of multisig wallets and EOAs currently
in control of Sablier Labs.

## Trustlessness

Despite having an admin, the Sablier Protocol remains trustless. Here's why:

1. The protocol is permissionless, i.e. it can be freely accessed by anyone with an Internet connection.
2. The protocol is persistent, i.e. the admin cannot pause it.
3. The streaming logic is non-upgradeable, i.e. the admin cannot tamper with the streams created by users.
4. There are no escape hatches that allow the admin to claim user funds.
5. There is a hard-coded upper limit of 10% to the fees that the admin can charge.

## Timelocks

The parameter changes that can be effected are NOT subject to a timelock. This means that the admin can execute any of
the functions listed above at any time.

## Governance

As a startup, Sablier has to deal with uncertainty regarding:

1. Protocol-market fit
2. Smart contract security

Attaining success in these areas is no easy feat, and as such, decentralizing the protocol's governance will not be an
initial priority.

Nonetheless, we believe that progressive decentralization is the most effective approach to scaling a smart contract
protocol. As the protocol matures, we will decentralize its governance incrementally.
