## Comptroller

The Sablier Protocol uses a Comptroller smart contract architecture for governance. The Comptroller acts as an
intermediary that has exclusive access to specific protocol functions. This design provides a more flexible and
centralized accross all protocols access control model while maintaining security.

## Lockup

Comptroller has the following permissions on each chain where `Lockup` is deployed:

| Permission         | Function                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allow to Hook      | [allowToHook](../reference/lockup/contracts/SablierLockup#allowtohook)           |
| Recover            | [recover](../reference/lockup/contracts/SablierLockup#recover)                   |
| Set Native Token   | [setNativeToken](../reference/lockup/contracts/SablierLockup#setnativetoken)     |
| Set NFT Descriptor | [setNFTDescriptor](../reference/lockup/contracts/SablierLockup#setnftdescriptor) |

## MerkleFactory

Comptroller has the following permission on each chain where the factories are deployed:

| Permission       | Function                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Set Native Token | [setNativeToken](../reference/airdrops/contracts/abstracts/abstract.SablierFactoryMerkleBase#setNativeToken) |

## Flow

Comptroller has the following permissions on each chain where `Flow` is deployed:

| Permission         | Function                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recover            | [recover](../reference/flow/contracts/SablierFlow#recover)                   |
| Set Native Token   | [setNativeToken](../reference/flow/contracts/SablierFlow#setnativetoken)     |
| Set NFT Descriptor | [setNFTDescriptor](../reference/flow/contracts/SablierFlow#setnftdescriptor) |

## Admin Addresses

Before the introduction of the Comptroller architecture, we used a direct "Admin" role for
governance. These admin accounts had the same authority as the current Comptroller contract, with direct access to
specific protocol functions. More concretely, the Admin is a collection of multisig wallets and EOAs currently in control of Sablier Labs.

## Trustlessness

Despite having an admin, the Sablier Protocol remains trustless. Here's why:

1. The protocol is permissionless, i.e. it can be freely accessed by anyone with an Internet connection.
2. The protocol is persistent, i.e. the admin cannot pause it.
3. The streaming logic is non-upgradeable, i.e. the admin cannot tamper with the streams created by users.
4. There are no escape hatches that allow the admin to claim user funds.
5. There is a hard-coded upper limit of 10% to the fees that the admin can charge.

## Timelocks

The parameter changes that can be effected are NOT subject to a timelock. This means that the admin can execute any of
the functions listed above at any time.

## Governance

As a startup, Sablier has to deal with uncertainty regarding:

1. Protocol-market fit
2. Smart contract security

Attaining success in these areas is no easy feat, and as such, decentralizing the protocol's governance will not be an
initial priority.

Nonetheless, we believe that progressive decentralization is the most effective approach to scaling a smart contract
protocol. As the protocol matures, we will decentralize its governance incrementally.
