title: What Is Sablier?
---

## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different components of "Sablier", some of which may confuse
new users.

- **The Sablier Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts that together create a protocol which
  facilitates streaming of ERC-20 assets on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains.
- **The Sablier Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Sablier protocol. The interface
  is only one of many ways to interact with the Sablier protocol.
- **Sablier Labs**: The company which developed the Sablier protocol, along with the user interfaces.
