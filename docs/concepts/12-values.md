By sharing our core values and cultural principles publicly, we aim to help you understand the ethos that drives our
work.

## Core Values

- Something related to security of system but it derives from the trust that team has in each other. If nNo trust, even
  a permissionless can be compromised, for example, during deployment.
- Listen to user. Derive features from users feedback.
- On a mission to increase internet GDP. That means growing the pie as well.
- A team works best when they behave like a family.
- Focus on identifying and solving problems and not tasks.
- Not afraid of taking responsibility individually if something goes wrong. We like to say "I will do it".

## Cultural Principles

- We don’t watch what we say. We are fully open about what we think, always.
- We don’t believe in hierarchies.
- We value creative solutions.
- We view ourselves as infinitely fallible and acknowledge that anyone can make big mistakes regardless of experience.
- We believe that progress is made through criticism and never hesitate to poke holes in each other’s ideas.
- We open-source our work and share our knowledge on public Internet forums.
