Sablier is a powerful onchain token distribution protocol. Here are some key definitions:

- **The Sablier Protocol**: A collection of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts to facilitate streaming of
  ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains. The Sablier Protocol consists of Lockup, Merkle Airdrops, and
  Flow.
- **The Sablier Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Sablier Protocol. The interface
  is only one of many ways to interact with the Sablier Protocol.
- **Sablier Labs**: The company that develops the Sablier Protocol, the Sablier Interface, and the documentation website
  you are reading right now.

Fun fact: "sablier" means "hourglass" in French.

## Sablier Protocol

A software protocol built with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) smart contracts, designed to facilitate distribution of
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens. The protocol employs a set of
persistent and non-upgradable smart contracts that prioritize security, censorship resistance, self-custody, and
functionality without the need for trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

Currently, Sablier consists of three separate systems:

- **Lockup**: facilitates vesting and vested airdrops
- **Merkle Airdrops**: enables on-chain airdrops
- **Flow**: for payroll, grants etc.

While most of these are licensed under BUSL-1.1, there are some components licensed under GPL v3. The source code can be
accessed on Sablier's [GitHub account](https://github.com/sablier-labs), and a detailed technical reference can be found
in the [Technical References](/reference/overview) section of this website.

As long as Ethereum and the other EVM chains continue to exist, every version of the Sablier Protocol that gets deployed
will operate continuously and without interruption, with a guarantee of 100% uptime.

## How does Sablier differ from traditional payment systems?

To understand the unique characteristics of Sablier, it is helpful to examine two aspects: the permissionless nature of
the protocol compared to traditional payment systems, the concept of streaming as an alternative to conventional payment
methods.

### Permissionless systems

Sablier is rooted in the essential ideas of open access and immutability, deriving inspiration from Ethereum's
foundational principles and the core values of the DeFi[^1] movement. These concepts are crucial in shaping a future
where financial services are accessible to everyone, irrespective of their geographical location or economic standing,
without prejudice or exposure to counterparty risks.

The permissionless design ensures that the protocol's services are open to the public, without any restrictions on who
can use them. Users have the liberty to establish new streams with any ERC-20 token, or interact with existing streams
as they wish. This feature stands in sharp contrast to conventional financial services that frequently impose
restrictions based on factors such as location, financial status, or age.

As an immutable system, the Sablier Protocol is non-upgradeable, meaning that no party can pause the contracts, reverse
transactions, or alter the users' streams in any way. This ensures the system remains transparent, secure, and resistant
to manipulation or abuse.

### Streaming vs conventional payments

Traditional payment systems generally involve lump-sum transfers, which rely on trust between parties, have slow
processing times, and are prone to errors. In the context of bank transfers, payments are also subject to substantial
fees and can face delays due to intermediaries.

By contrast, Sablier introduces the concept of token streaming, enabling users to make continuous, real-time payments on
a per-second basis. This innovative approach enables seamless, frictionless transactions and promotes increased
financial flexibility for users, businesses, and other entities. Sablier makes the passage of time itself the
trust-binding mechanism, unlocking business opportunities that were previously unavailable.

A good mental model to contrast streaming with conventional payment models is to view the former as "real-time finance"
or "continuous finance", and the latter as of "discrete finance".
