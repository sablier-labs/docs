Sablier is the powerhouse of token distribution protocols. We build decentralized applications to distribute your tokens
from one account to another, in realtime.

- **The Sablier Protocols**: A collection of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts to facilitate streaming of
  ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains. The Sablier Protocols consist of Lockup, Merkle Airdrops and
  Flow.
- **The Sablier Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Sablier Protocols. The interface
  is only one of many ways to interact with the Sablier Protocols.
- **Sablier Labs**: The company that develops the Sablier Protocols, the Sablier Interface, and the documentation
  website you are reading right now.

## Sablier Protocols

Sablier protocols are a collection of token distribution protocols developed with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)
smart contracts, designed to facilitate by-the-second payments for cryptocurrencies, specifically
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens. The protocols employ a set of
persistent and non-upgradable smart contracts that prioritize security, censorship resistance, self-custody, and
functionality without the need for trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

Currently, it consists of three protocols: **Lockup** to facilitates vesting and airstreams, **Merkle Airdrops** to
enable on-chain airdrops and **Flow** for payroll, grants etc. All of these are licensed under BUSL-1.1, and are
open-source and can be accessed on Sablier's [GitHub page](https://github.com/sablier-labs). Detailed technical
reference for each protocol can be found in the [Technical References](/reference/overview) section of this website.

As long as Ethereum and the other EVM chains continue to exist, every version of Sablier protocols that gets deployed
will operate continuously and without interruption, with a guarantee of 100% uptime.

Sablier is the first token streaming protocol ever built, tracing its roots back to 2019.

## How does Sablier differ from traditional payment systems?

To understand the unique characteristics of Sablier, it is helpful to examine two aspects: the concept of streaming as
an alternative to conventional payment methods, and the permissionless nature of the protocol compared to traditional
systems.

### Streaming vs conventional payments

Traditional payment systems generally involve lump-sum transfers, which rely on trust between parties, have slow
processing times, and are prone to errors. In the context of bank transfers, payments are also subject to substantial
fees and can face delays due to intermediaries.

By contrast, Sablier introduces the concept of token streaming, enabling users to make continuous, real-time payments on
a per-second basis. This innovative approach enables seamless, frictionless transactions and promotes increased
financial flexibility for users, businesses, and other entities. Sablier makes the passage of time itself the
trust-binding mechanism, unlocking business opportunities that were previously unavailable.

A good mental model to contrast streaming with conventional payment models is to view the former as "real-time finance"
or "continuous finance", and the latter as of "discrete finance".

### Permissionless systems

Sablier is rooted in the essential ideas of open access and immutability, deriving inspiration from Ethereum's
foundational principles and the core values of the DeFi[^1] movement. These concepts are crucial in shaping a future
where financial services are accessible to everyone, irrespective of their geographical location or economic standing,
without prejudice or exposure to counterparty risks.

The permissionless design ensures that the protocol's services are open to the public, without any restrictions on who
can use them. Users have the liberty to establish new streams with any ERC-20 token, or interact with existing streams
as they wish. This feature stands in sharp contrast to conventional financial services that frequently impose
restrictions based on factors such as location, financial status, or age.

As an immutable system, Sablier protocols are not upgradeable, meaning that no party can pause the contracts, reverse
transactions, or alter the users' streams in any way. This ensures the system remains transparent, secure, and resistant
to manipulation or abuse.

It is worth noting that the Protocol Admin has the right (but not the obligation) to impose a fee on every stream
created using specific ERC-20 tokens. However, this capability is known to all participants in advance, and to avert
misuse, the fee percentage is restricted to a range of 0% to 10%.
