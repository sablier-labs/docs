# Caveats

# The Graph vs. Envio

:::warning

If you're looking to support both subgraphs (The Graph) and indexers (Envio) into your apps, see the "Different Results
(\*)" ðŸ“Œ section below to understand how results from these two APIs may differ for the same entities.

:::

## General

In contrast to The Graph, Envio offers a slightly different Developer Experience (DX) in terms of indexer
implementation. While the query specifics don't change a lot for consumers, here are a few items to consider before
developing on top of the Sablier indexers/subgraphs:

### Querying Language

Both solutions create a **GraphQL** API for consumers to read data from. The Graph uses a customized subset of GraphQL
operations, which makes is impossible to use the same queries between both indexers and subgraphs, whereas Envio deploys
a GraphQL API over a Postgres DB. Here are some examples:

| Example              | The Graph                             | Envio                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Pagination           | `first`, `skip`                       | `limit`, `offset`                          |
| Filter by id         | `stream(id)`                          | `Stream(where: {id: {_eq: 1}})`            |
| Single vs. Plural    | `stream(id){}`, `streams{}`           | `Stream(where...){}` for both              |
| Nested items         | `campaigns{ id, asset: {id, symbol}}` | `Campaign{ asset_id, asset: {id, symbol}}` |
| Filter similar items | `assets(id: $id)`                     | `Asset(where: {id: {_iregex: $id}})`       |

Notes:

- For the 3rd example, querying for a single item vs. a collection will have separate keywords for The Graph. With
  Envio, you'll have to identify within the app itself if the query is supposed to yield one or multiple items. As you
  may tell, with Envio you'll query for `Stream` (capitalized), while with The Graph you'll query for `stream` or
  `streams`.
- For the 4th example, Envio Indexers will yield the contents of the `name` of an object with (`{}`), while the
  `<name>_id` label will ask for the identifier of the object (e.g., `asset` vs `asset_id`). Keep this in mind for
  "where" filtering.

### Handler Language

- The Graph: uses Assembly Script
- Envio: Sablier uses TypeScript by default, but you can also use JavaScript or Rescript

With Envio, one important mental model is in the concept of loaders vs. handlers. To optimize querying speeds, Envio
will ask you to write 2 methods: (i) a `loader`, where you can express which existing entities you're expecting to use
and mutate, and (ii) a `handler` where you manage these entities and/or create new ones.

Example: In the case of a Withdraw event, we weill **pre-load** the `Stream` entity and maybe the `Watcher`, while in
the second part we'll **handle** the creation of a new `Action` of type Withdraw, we'll update the `Stream`'s
`withdrawnAmount` and increase the `Watcher`'s index.

## Specifics

### Initializer Contracts

We've architected this indexer around a set of pre-configured contracts.

Similar to The Graph, we start by pre-configuring a set of contracts. While Envio's indexer doesn't have the same
[requirement](https://discord.com/channels/438038660412342282/438070183794573313/1153155902933831811) of pre-configuring
contracts to listen to, we'll keep this feature to ensure we can query against those entities, even if they'll be empty
at start.

We'll ensure contracts have been initialized (see the `watcher.ts` helper) by making a call against the initializer at
the start of each method. It should only come into play within the create handlers.

### Versioning and Lockup Flavors

While for The Graph's subgraphs we track flavor-first (see `subgraph.template.yaml` for the configuration of
`LockupLinear` and `..Dynamic`, `..Tranched` or the new `LockupMerged`), for Envio's indexers we'll have a version-first
approach.

Therefore, `LockupLinear` and its counterparts will be bundled under the same `Lockup<Version>` contract tracker (see
`./config.template.mustache`). Different versions of the protocol will be tracked separately, which is why we have
`Lockup_V20` (v2.0) and `Lockup_V21` (v2.1) in our configuration. Later on, inside the handler logic, we'll separate
contracts by flavor.

```tree title="Envio: Contract configuration tree (version-first)"
â””â”€â”€ contracts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ LockupV20/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ event: CreateLockupDynamicStream
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ event: CreateLockupLinearStream
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event: CreateLockupTrnchedStream
    â”œâ”€â”€ LockupV21/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ event: CreateLockupDynamicStream
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ event: CreateLockupLinearStream
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event: CreateLockupTranchedStream
    â””â”€â”€ LockupV22/
```

```tree title="The Graph: Contract configuration tree (flavor-first)"
â””â”€â”€ contracts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ LockupDynamic/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ event: CreateLockupDynamicStreamV20
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event: CreateLockupDynamicStreamV21
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event: CreateLockupDynamicStreamV22
    â”œâ”€â”€ LockupLinear/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ event: CreateLockupLinearStreamV20
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event: CreateLockupLinearStreamV21
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event: CreateLockupLinearStreamV22
    â”œâ”€â”€ LockupTranched/
    â””â”€â”€ LockupMerged/
```

## Contract Calls

Outside of data provided directly by the event arguments, one can access additional information through contract calls.
While The Graph provides a dedicated API (binding an ABI to an address, calling `contract.try_method()`), Envio is less
opinionated. A good example of contract calls can be found in our `helpers/asset.ts` where we use `viem` and a custom
caching mechanism to search for asset details.

## Different Results (\*)

Due to the cross-chain indexing aspect, entities in Envio will need to have a chainId suffix attached to them to ensure
they're unique across the board. At the same time, there are some minor features missing, which will cause some
differences listed below.

- For Envio indexers, entities will have fully specified identifiers (meaning chainId included)
  1.  `lockup-envio`: the `Action`, `Asset`, `Batch`, `Batcher`, `Contract` have a `-chainId` appended to the ID
  2.  `merkle-envio`: the `Action`, `Asset` and `Factory` have a `-chainId` appended to the ID

While we've tried to refactor our The Graph entities to share similar identifiers, please double check in cases when you
use both query resolves (The Graph and Envio) at the same time.

:::tip

To avoid writing separate systems when assigning variables to queries, you can use slightly different filters. For
example, given a different `id` for an entity like `Asset` (`address` in The Graph and `address-chainId` in Envio) you
can query for certain assets with:

1. `asset(id: $assetId)` for The Graph
2. `Asset(where: {id: {_iregex: $assetId}})`

With `assetId` in both cases being assigned to the Asset's `address`.
