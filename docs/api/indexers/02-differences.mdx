# Differences (The Graph vs. Envio)

:::info

If you're looking to support both subgraphs (The Graph) and indexers (Envio) into your apps, please make sure to scroll
down to the "Different Results" section to understand how results from both APIs may differ for the same entities.

:::

## General

In contrast to The Graph, Envio offers a slightly different Developer Experience (DX) in terms of indexer
implementation. While for consumers, the query specifics don't change a lot, here are a few items to consider before
developing on top of the Sablier indexers/subgraphs:

### Querying Language

Both solutions create a **GraphQL** API for consumers to read data from. It is important to note that The Graph uses a
customized subset of GraphQL operations, which makes is impossible to use the same queries between both indexers and
subgraphs, whereas Envio deploys a GraphQL API over a Postgres DB. Some examples:

| Example              | The Graph                             | Envio                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pagination           | `first`, `skip`                       | `limit`, `offset`                             |
| Filter by id         | `stream(id)`                          | `Stream(where: {id: {_eq: 1}})`               |
| Single vs. Plural    | `stream(id){}`, `streams{}`           | `Stream(where...){}` for both                 |
| Nested items         | `campaigns{ id, asset: {id, symbol}}` | `Campaign{ asset, assetObject: {id, symbol}}` |
| Filter similar items | `assets(id: $id)`                     | `Asset(where: {id: {_iregex: $id}})`          |

#### Important Notes

For the 3rd example, querying for a single item vs. a collection will have separate keywords for The Graph. With Envio,
you'll have to identify within the app itself if the query is supposed to yield one or multiple items. As you may tell,
with Envio you'll query for `Stream` (capitalized) while with The Graph you'll query for `stream` or `streams`.

For the 4th example, in Envio indexers the name of an object will yield its `id`, while the `<name>Object` label will
ask for the object itself (e.g. `asset` vs `assetObject`).

:::warning

This `asset` vs `assetObject` discrepancy may change in future versions of Envio. Please checks the docs accordingly
before developing features on top of the Sablier V2 indexers.

### Handler Language

- The Graph: uses Assembly script
- Envio: we've chosen Typescript, but you can use JS, TS or Rescript

For Envio, one important mental model is in the concept of loaders vs. handlers. To optimize querying speeds, Envio will
ask you to write 2 methods: a `loader`, where you can express which existing entities you're expecting to use and
mutate, and a `handler` where you manage these entities and/or create new ones.

Example: In the case of a Withdraw event, we'll **pre-load** the `Stream` entity and maybe the `Watcher`, while in the
second part we'll **handle** the creation of a new `Action` of type Withdraw, we'll update the `Stream`'s
`withdrawnAmount` and increase the `Watcher`'s index.

## Specifics

### Initializer Contracts

We've architected this indexer around a set of pre-configured contracts.

Similar to The Graph, we start by pre-configuring a set of contracts. While Envio's indexer doesn't have the same
[requirement](https://discord.com/channels/438038660412342282/438070183794573313/1153155902933831811) of pre-configuring
contracts to listen to, we'll keep this feature to ensure we can query against those entities, even if they'll be empty
at start.

We'll ensure contracts have been initialized (see the `watcher.ts` helper) by making a call against the initializer at
the start of each method. It should only come into play within the create handlers.

### Versioning and Lockup Flavors

While for The Graph's subgraphs we track flavor-first (see `subgraph.template.yaml` for the configuration of
`SablierV2LockupLinear` and `SablierV2LockupDynamic`), for Envio's indexers we'll have a version-first approach.

Therefore, `LockupLinear` and `LockupDynamic` will be bundled under the same `Lockup<Version>` contract tracker (see
`./config.template.mustache`). Different versions of the protocol will be tracked separately, which is why we have
`Lockup_V20` (v2.0) and `Lockup_V21` (v2.1) in our configuration. Later on, inside the handler logic, we'll separate
contracts by flavor.

```tree title="Envio: Contract configuration tree (version-first)"
└── contracts/
    ├── LockupV20/
    │   ├── event: CreateLockupDynamicStream
    │   └── event: CreateLockupLinearStream
    └── LockupV21/
        ├── event: CreateLockupDynamicStream
        └── event: CreateLockupLinearStream
```

```tree title="The Graph: Contract configuration tree (flavor-first)"
└── contracts/
    ├── LockupDynamic/
    │   ├── event: CreateLockupDynamicStreamV20
    │   └── event: CreateLockupDynamicStreamV21
    └── LockupLinear/
        ├── event: CreateLockupLinearStreamV20
        └── event: CreateLockupLinearStreamV21
```

## Different Results (\*)

Due to the cross-chain indexing aspect, entities in Envio will need to have a chainId suffix attached to them to ensure
they're unique across the board. At the same time, there are some minor features missing, which will cause some
differences listed below.

- For Envio indexers, some entities will have different identifiers (from what The Graph's subgraph have):
  1.  `protocol-envio`: the `Action`, `Asset`, `Batch`, `Batcher`, `Contract` have a `-chainId` appended to the ID
  2.  `merkle-envio`: the `Action`, `Asset` and `Factory` have a `-chainId` appended to the ID

:::tip

To avoid writing separate systems when assigning variables to queries, you can use slightly different filters. For
example, given the different `id`s of an `Asset` (`address` in The Graph and `address-chainId` in Envio) you can query
for certain assets with:

1. `asset(id: $assetId)` for The Graph
2. `Asset(where: {id: {_iregex: $assetId}})`

With `assetId` in both cases being assigned to the Asset's `address`.
