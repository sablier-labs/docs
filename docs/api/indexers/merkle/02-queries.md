Building on top of the [entity structure](/api/subgraphs/merkle/entities) defined earlier, here are some common GraphQL
queries for fetching data from the Sablier V2 subgraph.

### Recent streams

```graphql title="The 10 most recent campaigns"
Campaign(
  limit: 10
  order_by: {timestamp: desc}
) {
  id
}

# OR

Campaign(
  limit: 10
  order_by: {subgraphId: desc}
) {
  id
}

```

### Paginated campaigns

To query campaigns in sets/pages we can use the unique `subgraphId`.

This query includes pagination.

```graphql title="The next campaigns indexed before the last seen subgraphId"
Campaign(
  limit: $first
  offset: $skip
  order_by: {subgraphId: desc}
  where: { subgraphId: {_lt: $subgraphId} }
) {
  id
}
```

### Campaigns by admin and asset

To search for campaigns deployed by a certain address (e.g. a DAO or a popular token issuer), we can filter using the
`admin` field. Even more, we can use the token address to restrict the search further.

This query includes pagination.

:::info

This examples is fully configured with a query "name" (and expected variables) as well as a "fragment". The fragment is
a simple GraphQL description of what a certain entity (here the campaign) looks like.

```graphql title="The next campaigns created by an address with a certain asset"
query getAirstreams_ByAsset($first: Int!, $skip: Int!, $asset: String!, $subgraphId: BigInt!, $chainId: BigInt!) {
  Campaign(
    limit: $first
    offset: $skip
    order_by: {subgraphId: desc}
    where: {
      _and: [
        { asset_id: {_eq: $asset} }
        { subgraphId: {_lt: $subgraphId}}
        { chainId: {_eq: $chainId}}
      ]
    }
  ) {
    ...CampaignFragment
  }
}

const CampaignFragment = gql(/* GraphQL */ `
  fragment CampaignFragment on Campaign {
    id
    subgraphId
    address
    chainId
    category
    hash
    timestamp
    admin
    lockup
    root
    expires
    expiration
    ipfsCID
    aggregateAmount
    totalRecipients
    clawbackTime
    streamCliff
    streamCliffDuration
    streamTotalDuration
    streamCancelable
    streamTransferable
    claimedAmount
    claimedCount
    version
    asset_id
    asset {
      ...AssetFragment
    }
    factory_id
    factory {
      ...FactoryFragment
    }
  }
`);

```

### Claim actions of a user on a certain campaign

To check if a user has claimed their share from a distribution campaign we can look for a "Claim" action performed by or
on behalf of that user. If the query yields a result, it means the uses has already claimed from the Airstream.

```graphql title="Claim action of a user on a certain campaign"
query getClaim($campaignId: ID!, $user: String!) {
  Action(where: { campaign_id: { _eq: $campaignId }, category: { _eq: "Claim" }, claimRecipient: { _eq: $uer } }) {
    campaign {
      id
      lockup
    }
    claimStreamId
    claimTokenId
    claimRecipient
    category
  }
}
```
