# Sablier Lockup

Sablier's [Lockup](/concepts/lockup/overview) streams are used for the [vesting](/apps/features/vesting) and some of the
[airdrops](/apps/features/airdrops) functionality of the Sablier Interfaces.

Lockup-native functionality is powered by:

- The `@sablier/subgraphs/apps/lockup` subgraph
- The `@sablier/subgraphs/apps/lockup-envio` indexer

#### Naming convention

As per our endpoint [naming convention](/api/overview#endpoints--slugs), subgraph deployments of Sablier Lockup will
follow the `sablier-v2-*` structure (e.g. `sablier-v2` for Mainnet, `sablier-v2-base` for Base).

#### Tips and tricks

:::tip

To avoid writing the same entity definitions over and over again, check out
[Fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments).

```graphql

fragment StreamFragment on Stream {
  id
  sender
  recipient
  contract {
    id
    address
  }
}

query getStreams(...){
  streams(...){
    ...StreamFragment
  }
}

```

:::

:::note

Since Sablier uses multiple immutable contract versions and deployments (e.g.
[lockup's variants](/guides/lockup/deployments#previous-versions)), if you're going to perform onchain actions on
queried streams (e.g. getting the `streamedAmountOf`) make sure you call those methods on the right contract. For
subgraphs/indexers, we store the source contract under `stream.contract.address`.
