## Preparations

The data flow applied to this indexer is identical to the one used in the
[lockup subgraph](/api/lockup/the-graph/architecture).

Similar to The Graph, we start by pre-configuring a set of contracts. While Envio's indexer doesn't have the same
[requirement](https://discord.com/channels/438038660412342282/438070183794573313/1153155902933831811) of pre-configuring
contracts to listen to, we'll keep this feature to ensure we can query against those entities, even if they'll be empty
at start.

We'll ensure contracts have been initialized (see the `watcher.ts` helper) by making a call against the initializer at
the start of each method. It should only come into play within the create handlers.

```ts title="packages/constants/.../sepolia.ts"
export let chainId = 11155111;
/** It uses the same structure as the configuration files of the subgraphs */
...
```

After setting up each chain, we'll aggregate configuration to feed into the `config.yaml` all at once, as Envio uses a
multi-chain approach instead of establishing a separate endpoint for each indexed chain. Check
[`packages/constants/.../bundles`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs/tree/main/packages/constants/src/bundles)
to see how this works. to

## Configurations

Using this data, we'll call the `pnpm run setup` script. In turn it will:

1. **[Setup]** Clean artifacts and older files
2. **[Template]** Convert TS files into JS for mustache to use in the next step
3. **[Template]** Use mustache to create a specific `config.yaml` (from `config.template.mustache`) using the aggregated
   chain details (from `/constants/chains/index.ts`)
4. **[Codegen]** Run codegen using the files prepared above, as well as the handlers implementation

## Running locally

In order to run things locally, you can use the `pnpm dev` command which does all the "configuration" steps as well as
booting up the Envio dependencies and local node. Check the official Envio docs for more on this.

## Multi-version support

Sablier is a fast moving protocol, with a new deployment every few months. Up to this point we can already see V2.0 and
V2.1 supported by the client interface and integrators.

To offer a backwards compatible subgraph (between Sablier Core/ Sablier Periphery **v2.0** and **v2.x**) we'll aggregate
the ABIs of the two versions. This will cause the configuration file to contain similar events between different
versions of Lockup contract.

Different from how we handle this for [subgraphs](/apps/lockup/the-graph), `Lockup Linear`, `Lockup Dynamic` and
`Lockup Tranched` will be bundled under the same `Lockup<Version>` contract tracker `config.yaml`. Versions of the
protocol will be tracked separately, which is why we have `Lockup_V20` (v2.0) and `Lockup_V21` (v2.1) in our
configuration. Later on, inside the handler logic, we'll separate contracts by flavor.
