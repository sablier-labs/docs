# Similarities

Envio indexers are designed to mirror the functionality and structure of the The Graph subgraphs.

For an introduction into the base Sablier primitives and some architectural choices, make sure to check out the
[lockup subgraph](/api/lockup/the-graph/entities) before reading about the `lockup-envio` indexer.

The same (or similar) entities are used throughout both The Graph and Envio setups, as well as lockup and merkle
deployments.
