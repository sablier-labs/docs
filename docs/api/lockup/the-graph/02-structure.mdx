We'll break down the [schema](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/blob/main/apps/lockup/schema.graphql) into
primary and secondary entities.

| Type      | Entities                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary   | Contract, Action, Stream, Asset, Segment, Tranche |
| Secondary | Batch, Batcher, Watcher                           |

## Contract

The subgraph is designed to track multiple deployments. Therefore, at any given time the indexer may listen for updates
on many instances of `SablierV2LockupLinear` or `SablierV2LockupDynamic` contracts .

A unique `alias` will be attributed to every contract, such that contracts (and later streams) will be identifiable
through both a long form and a short form identifier. See the [Stream](#stream) for details.

---

## Action

Events emitted by the Sablier Lockup contracts will:

1. Be used to mutate the data stored in the individual `Stream` entities
2. Be stored as historical logs (list of `Action`) to show the evolution of a related stream

Based on the schema defined `ActionCategory`, the following actions will be tracked by the subgraph:

| Action         | Contract Events                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Approval       | Approval                                            |
| ApprovalForAll | ApprovalForAll                                      |
| Create         | CreateLockupLinearStream, CreateLockupDynamicStream |
| Cancel         | CancelLockupStream                                  |
| Renounce       | RenounceLockupStream                                |
| Transfer       | Transfer                                            |
| Withdraw       | WithdrawFromLockupStream                            |

To keep all actions under the same umbrella, some details will be stored under general purpose attributes like
`amountA`, `amountB`, `addressA`, `addressB` which based on the type of action can be resolved to context-specific
values. Am example can be found
[here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/blob/main/apps/lockup/src/mappings/handle-stream.ts#L79-L82) for the
Cancel event.

## Stream

### Identifying

Inside the contracts, streams will be assigned a unique `tokenId` (or `streamId`). While this makes it easy to identify
items at the contract level, we need to consider the following for both subgraphs and client interfaces:

- items should be uniquely recognizable across multiple contract instances
- items should be uniquely identifiable across multiple chains
- items should be identifiable with short, easy to digest names

To address these observations, the subgraph uses two related identifiers for a Stream.

| Type           | Description                                                                                         | Example                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Stream.id`    | A self-explanatory structure built using the following structure: `contractAddress-chainId-tokenId` | <nobr>`0xAB..12-137-21`</nobr> |
| `Stream.alias` | A short version of the `id` where the contract is aliased: `contractAlias-chainId-tokenId`          | <nobr>`LL-137-21`</nobr>       |

Both examples from the table above translate to: **_a stream on Polygon (chain id `137`), within the Lockup Linear
contract at address `0xAB..12`, with the tokenId `21`_**.

:::note

The aliases defined in the subgraph will be used by client apps to resolve data about a stream. Make sure to keep them
in sync, avoid conflicts and regard them as immutable (once decided, never change them).

:::

### Aliases


:::note

Following the merger of LockupLinear, LockupDynamic, and LockupTranched into a single contract, the alias for all streaming shapes was standardized as `LK`.

:::

To provide a simple visual structure, while also accounting for future stream curves (backwards compatibility) we use
the following abbreviations as aliases:

- Lockup Linear V1.0 contracts become `LL`, e.g. `LL-137-1`
- Lockup Linear V1.1 contracts become `LL2`, e.g. `LL2-137-1`
- Lockup Dynamic V1.0 contracts become `LD`, e.g. `LD-137-1`
- Lockup Dynamic V1.1 contracts become `LD2`, e.g. `LD2-137-1`
- Sablier Lockup contracts become `LK`, e.g `LK-137-1`

### Relevant parties

Within the larger Sablier ecosystem, the number of relevant entities participating in a stream (and the dynamics between
them) has grown past the immutable `sender` and `recipient` (as in V1). Therefore, we identify the following parties
involved in a stream.

#### The recipient (gets paid\*)

As funds are being streamed, they will slowly become eligible to withdraw and spend unlocked tokens. The `recipient` is
defined at the start of the stream but can change as a result of a transfer.

On transfer, the old recipient moves the NFT (the stream itself) to another address, which becomes the new recipient.
Rights to withdraw and claim future streamed funds are naturally transferred to this new address.

#### The sender (will pay\*)

They are an immutable party, defined at the start of the stream. Based on the configuration chosen for the stream, they
will be entitled to later cancel the stream, renounce it (disable cancelability) or withdraw on behalf of the recipient.

In case of a cancelation, the `sender` will receive any unstreamed tokens as part of the refund.

#### The funder

When the stream is created, they provide the tokens to be gradually streamed to the recipient. Usually, they are the
same entity as the sender. However, there may be cases when someone wishes to create a stream on another user's behalf,
while also marking them as the sender. In that case, this initial address will be accounted for as the stream's
`funder`.

#### The proxender (relevant only for Lockup V1.0, deprecated with Lockup V1.1+)

:::warning Warning: Deprecated

Sablier Lockup V1.0 involved users deploying a "PRBProxy" contract through which they interacted with the Sablier
contracts. With LOckup V1.1+, this is not the case any more because no proxy contracts are used anymore. Therefore, if
you're not looking to support old versions of the protocol, you don't need to worry about `proxenders` and `proxy`.

:::

[In V2.0], while not mandatory for the core functionality, Sablier used [PRBProxy](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-proxy)
in its architecture. The official client interfaces provided support for functionality exposed through both EOAs and this
proxy integration.

For streams created within this "extended" ecosystem, a few attributes and entities will change meaning as such:

- the `stream.proxied` flag will turn `true`
- the `stream.sender` address will resolve to a `proxy` contract address, owned by the `stream.proxender`
- the `stream.proxender` address (usually an EOA) will control this `sender` proxy and instruct it to perform actions on
  its behalf (like a special account)

| #   | Examples of supported flows                                                                                          |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `0xF` the funder (EOA), funds a stream on behalf of `0xA`, the sender (EOA), towards `0xB` the recipient (EOA)       |
| 2   | `0xA` the sender (EOA), creates a stream towards `0xB` the recipient (EOA)                                           |
| 3   | `0xA` the proxender (EOA), through their proxy `0xA1` (proxy contract), creates a stream towards `0xB` the recipient |

While other combinations are possible, the most likely ones (as supported by the official interfaces) will be similar to
example #3.

:::warning

For Lockup V1.1 and above, you should only rely on the `recipient` and `sender` parties.

## Asset

Tokens (ERC20) streamed through the protocol will be defined through an `Asset` entity.

:::info

As a development caveat, some ERC20 contracts are designed to store details (e.g. name, symbol) as `bytes32` and not
`string`. Prior to deploying a subgraph, make sure you take into account these details as part of any Asset entity
implementation. For examples, see the asset "helper" files inside this subgraph's repository code.

:::

---

## Segment

The custom emission curve used by Lockup Dynamic streams will be defined as a sequence of
[segments](/concepts/lockup/segments). This entity will store data regarding those segments, which will be later used to
reconstruct the shape of the curve client side.

---

## Tranche

The custom emission curve used by Lockup Tranched streams will be defined as a sequence of
[tranches](/concepts/lockup/tranches). This entity will store data regarding those tranches, which will be later used to
reconstruct the shape of the curve client side.

:::tip

Tranches can also be represented as a set of two segments (one horizontal, one vertical) so client apps may benefit from
artificially creating segments from tranches.

:::

---

## Batch and Batcher

The lockup-periphery, while not explicitly tracked by the subgraph will offer some extra functionality to proxy-sourced
streams. One of these functionalities will be **batch stream creation** (or **stream grouping**). Using methods like
`createWithDurations` or `createWithTimestamps` a sender will be able to create multiple streams at once - considered
part of the same batch.

To identify these relationships between stream items, the `Batch` entity will group items created in the same
transaction, by finding events emitted with the same tx hash. The `Batcher` will then assign a user-specific unique
index to every group.

---

## Watcher

The Watcher (one for the entire subgraph) will provide specific utilities to the entire system, like global stream
identifiers (a numeric id unique to a stream across all contract instances) and global action identifiers.
