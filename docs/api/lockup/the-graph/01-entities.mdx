## Entity Architecture

GraphQL entities defined by the Sablier subgraphs are meant to mirror the functionality exposed by our core lockup
contracts. To achieve this, events are stored as historical entries (e.g. Action) while also being used to mutate
attributes for live entities (e.g. Stream).

Inside the **lockup** subgraph, the
[`schema.graphql`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/blob/main/apps/lockup/schema.graphql) file is responsible
of defining the following Sablier entities:

### Primary

| Entity   | Description                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract | Instances of `SablierV2LockupLinear` or `..Dynamic` or `..Tranched`                    |
| Action   | Emitted events transformed into historical entries (e.g. Create, Withdraw)             |
| Stream   | Primary entity tracking the up to date state of a stream                               |
| Asset    | The ERC20 asset that is being streamed                                                 |
| Segment  | The function segment used to build the custom curve in cases of Lockup Dynamic streams |
| Tranche  | The tranche/step used to build shapes powered by Lockup Tranched streams               |

### Secondary

| Entity  | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch   | An entity grouping a set of stream created all at once (action done through the `lockup-periphery`)             |
| Batcher | An entity resolving 1:1 to a stream sender, in charge of managing the count of "batches" of streams one creates |
| Watcher | A singleton data store for subgraph-level unique indexes such as the stream or action index                     |
