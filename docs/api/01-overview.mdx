# The Sablier APIs

Sablier relies on specific dependencies to source data or manage off-chain flows. All of these are either public or
fully open-source, so feel free to roam around and suggest improvements or optimizations where needed.

## Subgraphs and Indexers (GraphQL)

As an alternative to reading data from the contracts or listening to onchain events, we use a set of subgraphs and
indexers. These act as a middleware between the chain and our interfaces and allow for caching, formatting and querying
data.

### The Graph's Subgraphs

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) has been the vendor of choice for the EVM space for the past few years. We've been
integrating The Graph since 2019 with Sablier V1. For Sablier V2, we designed a special set of feature-oriented
subgraphs used not only by us (in the official apps) but by 3rd party services (e.g. snapshot) and integrators alike.

These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph Network, as well as on the The Graph Hosted Service. They can be used to query
Sablier data from the official [endpoints](/api/subgraphs/endpoints).

Read more in the dedicated page about our `protocol` and `merkle` [subgraphs](/api/subgraphs/overview) or check out the
[official vendor docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/).

### Envio's Indexers

[Envio](https://envio.dev/) offers a suite of fast and flexible tools to access on-chain data. Their HyperIndex service
provides for a similar GraphQL driven API to access cached data and serve it into our client interfaces.

We designed a set of indexers that mimic the features and entities exposed by subgraphs and take advantage of the speed
and optimized environment configured through HyperIndex. Read more in the dedicated page about our `protocol-envio` and
`merkle-envio` [indexers](/api/indexers/overview).

## Merkle API (Rust)

To support our Merkle distribution (a.k.a. [Airstreams](/apps/features#airstreams)) system we developed a backend
service called `@sablier/v2-merkle-api`. This backend deals with the validation, creation and management of Merkle
trees, used to define eligibility and claiming rules for Sablier's Airstream campaigns.

This service is open-source and can be used by integrators as a plug-n-play solution to support (and even deploy)
similar campaigns from their own dashboards. Read more in the dedicated page about the `merkle-api`
[indexers](/api/merkle-api/overview).
