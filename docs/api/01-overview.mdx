# The Sablier APIs

Sablier relies on specific dependencies to source data and enable off-chain features. All of these are either public or
open-source, so feel free to roam around and suggest improvements or optimizations.open-source, so feel free to roam
around and suggest improvements or optimizations.

Below, we will cover:

1. The [solutions](#solutions) we use to index and query data
2. The [interface-to-protocol](#products) links between these solutions
3. The raw entities emitted by the contracts

## Solutions

![Banner Sablier APIs](/banner/docs-banner-apis.webp)

As an alternative to reading data from the contracts or listening to onchain events, we use a collection of subgraphs
and indexers. These service act as a middleware between the chain and our interfaces and allow for caching, formatting
and querying data. For more advanced features like Merkle tree generation (used in Airdrops), we've written own SDKs and
open-sourced some of them.

:::note Playground

To preview the GraphQL APIs for subgraphs and indexers, you can plug them into
[Hasura's](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql) online explorer.
[Here](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/57079/sablier-v2/version/latest)'s
an example setup of a Mainnet subgraph for Sablier Lockup.

## Subgraphs

### The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) has been the vendor of choice in the EVM space for the past few years. We've been
using The Graph since we launched Sablier Legacy in 2019. For our current apps, we created a special set of
feature-oriented subgraphs used internally and by third-party services (e.g., Snapshot) and integrators.

These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph Network, as well as on the The Graph Hosted Service. They can be used to query
Sablier data from the official [endpoints](/api/lockup/endpoints). Each network has its own subgraph endpoints.

- [Lockup endpoints](/api/lockup/endpoints)
- [Lockup subgraph](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/apps/lockup) (Vesting)
- [Flow endpoints](/api/flow/endpoints)
- [Flow subgraph](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/apps/flow) (Payments)
- [Airdrops endpoints](/api/airdrops/endpoints)
- [Airdrops subgraph](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/apps/merkle) (Airdrops, Airstreams)
- [The Graph docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/)

#### Endpoints / Slugs

Every subgraph deployment will have a `slug` generated by The Graph. The slug is derived from the subgraph name and can
be found in the Studio Development Query URL. We use the following naming convention for subgraphs:

| Subgraph            | Example                             | Product or Concept                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sablier-v2-*`      | `sablier-v2`, `sablier-v2-optimism` | [Lockup](/concepts/lockup/overview) (Vesting)  |
| `sablier-v2-flow-*` | `sablier-v2-flow-arbitrum`          | [Flow](/concepts/flow/overview) (Payments)     |
| `sablier-v2-ms-*`   | `sablier-v2-ms-base`                | [Merkle](/concepts/merkle-airdrops) (Airdrops) |
| `sablier-*`         | `sablier-optimism`                  | [V1](/api/legacy) (Legacy)                     |

There is a `v2` in the subgraph name due to historical reasons. Sablier used to be versioned as `v1` and `v2`, and the
subgraphs were named accordingly. However, we have since dropped this versioning scheme.

### Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev/) offers a suite of fast and flexible tools to access onchain data. Their HyperIndex service
provides a similar GraphQL-driven API to access cached data and serve it into our client interfaces.

We created indexers that mimic the features and entities exposed by subgraphs and take advantage of the speed and
optimized environment configured through HyperIndex.

All networks share the same indexer endpoint (for one indexer type), as Envio promotes a cross-chain indexing
architecture.

## Sablier SDKs

### Merkle API

To support the Merkle distribution (see [Airdrops](/apps/features/airdrops)) system, we developed a backend service
called `@sablier/merkle-api`. This API deals with the validation, creation, and management of Merkle trees, which are
used to define eligibility and claiming rules for Sablier's Airstream campaigns.

The service is open-source and can be used by integrators as a plug-n-play solution to support (and even deploy) similar
campaigns. Read more on the dedicated page about the `merkle-api` service [here](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/overview).
