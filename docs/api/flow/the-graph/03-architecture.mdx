## Preparations

In order to start indexing all whitelisted Flow contracts we need a genesis event. With Sablier Flow, there is no
factory pattern so we couldn't rely on a
[data source](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#data-source-templates) contract. The next
best things for a "genesis" point was to rely on the first event triggered by the earliest registered onchain contract

To reduce the number of dependencies required to kickstart a subgraph, we chose to rely on this approach instead of
implementing a separate registry contract. You should extend the file described
[here](/api/lockup/the-graph/architecture#preparations) with the following

```ts title="packages/constants/.../sepolia.ts"
...
export let startBlock_flow = 6618000;

/** Rule: keep addresses lowercased */

/**
 * Keep aliases unique and always in sync with the frontend
 * @example export let linear = [[address1, alias1, version1], [address2, alias2, version2]]
 */

...

export let flow: string[][] = [
  ["0x83dd52fca44e069020b58155b761a590f12b59d3", "FL", "V10"],
];

// highlight-start
/**
 * The initializer contract is used to trigger the indexing of all other contracts.
 * It should be a linear contract, the oldest/first one deployed on this chain.
 * â†ª ðŸš¨ On any new chain, please create a Flow stream to kick-off the indexing flow
 */

export let initializer_flow = flow[0][0];
//highlight-end
```

## Configurations

Using this data, we'll call the `yarn deploy:<chain_name>` script. In turn it will:

0. **[Chain]** Lock onto a specified chain
1. **[Setup]** Clean artifacts and older files
2. **[Template]** Convert TS files into JS for mustache to use in the next step
3. **[Template]** Use mustache to create a specific `subgraph.yaml` (from `subgraph.template.yaml`) using the selected
   chain's details
4. **[Template]** Duplicate the selected chain's configuration file as the "current" `env.ts` (for possible imports
   directly in Assembly Script)
5. **[Codegen]** Run codegen using the files prepared above, as well as the handlers implementation
6. **[Deploy]** Deploy the code to the endpoint selected based on the specified chain
