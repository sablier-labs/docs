We'll break down the [schema](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/blob/main/apps/flow/schema.graphql) into primary
and secondary entities.

| Type      | Entities                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Primary   | Contract, Action, Stream, Asset |
| Secondary | Batch, Batcher, Watcher         |

## Contract

The subgraph is designed to track multiple deployments. Therefore, at any given time the indexer may listen for updates
on many instances of `SablierFlow` contracts .

A unique `alias` will be attributed to every contract, such that contracts (and later streams) will be identifiable
through both a long form and a short form identifier. See the [Stream](#stream) for details.

---

## Action

Events emitted by the Sablier Flow contracts will:

1. Be used to mutate the data stored in the individual `Stream` entities
2. Be stored as historical logs (list of `Action`) to show the evolution of a related stream

Based on the schema defined `ActionCategory`, the following actions will be tracked by the subgraph:

| Action         | Contract Events        |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Approval       | Approval               |
| ApprovalForAll | ApprovalForAll         |
| Adjust         | AdjustFlowStream       |
| Create         | CreateFlowStream       |
| Deposit        | DepositFlowStream      |
| Pause          | PauseFlowStream        |
| Refund         | RefundFromFlowStream   |
| Restart        | RestartFlowStream      |
| Transfer       | Transfer               |
| Void           | VoidFlowStream         |
| Withdraw       | WithdrawFromFlowStream |

To keep all actions under the same umbrella, some details will be stored under general purpose attributes like
`amountA`, `amountB`, `addressA`, `addressB` which based on the type of action can be resolved to context-specific
values. Am example can be found
[here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/blob/52f00f31a89c91dcf24480a5d7d8b25c84467f15/apps/flow/src/mappings/handle-stream.ts#L53-L56)
for the Adjust event.

## Stream

### Identifying

Inside the contracts, streams will be assigned a unique `tokenId` (or `streamId`). While this makes it easy to identify
items at the contract level, we need to consider the following for both subgraphs and client interfaces:

- items should be uniquely recognizable across multiple contract instances
- items should be uniquely identifiable across multiple chains
- items should be identifiable with short, easy to digest names

To address these observations, the subgraph uses two related identifiers for a Stream.

| Type           | Description                                                                                         | Example                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Stream.id`    | A self-explanatory structure built using the following structure: `contractAddress-chainId-tokenId` | <nobr>`0xAB..12-137-21`</nobr> |
| `Stream.alias` | A short version of the `id` where the contract is aliased: `contractAlias-chainId-tokenId`          | <nobr>`FL-137-21`</nobr>       |

Both examples from the table above translate to: **_a stream on Polygon (chain id `137`), within the Flow contract at
address `0xAB..12`, with the tokenId `21`_**.

:::note

The aliases defined in the subgraph will be used by client apps to resolve data about a stream. Make sure to keep them
in sync, avoid conflicts and regard them as immutable (once decided, never change them).

:::

### Aliases

To provide a simple visual structure, while also accounting for future stream curves (backwards compatibility) we use
the following abbreviations as aliases:

- FLOW V1.0 contracts become `FL`, e.g. `FL-137-1`

### Relevant parties

#### The recipient (gets paid\*)

As funds are being streamed, they will slowly become eligible to withdraw and spend unlocked tokens. The `recipient` is
defined at the start of the stream but can change as a result of a transfer.

On transfer, the old recipient moves the NFT (the stream itself) to another address, which becomes the new recipient.
Rights to withdraw and claim future streamed funds are naturally transferred to this new address.

#### The sender (will pay\*)

They are an immutable party, defined at the start of the stream. Based on the configuration chosen for the stream, they
will be entitled to later pause the stream, void it (stop and erased any accrued debt), withdraw on behalf of the
recipient or refund any of the unstreamed tokens.

## Asset

Tokens (ERC20) streamed through the protocol will be defined through an `Asset` entity.

:::info

As a development caveat, some ERC20 contracts are designed to store details (e.g. name, symbol) as `bytes32` and not
`string`. Prior to deploying a subgraph, make sure you take into account these details as part of any Asset entity
implementation. For examples, see the asset "helper" files inside this subgraph's repository code.

## Batch and Batcher

The SablierFlow contracts through the implementation of the IBatch interface allow executing multiple actions in the
same transaction. One of these functionalities will be **batch stream creation** (or **stream grouping**). Using the
`batch` that receives the encoded data of multiple `create` function calls, a sender will be able to create multiple
streams at once - considered part of the same batch. This is similar with the
[lockup create multiple functions](/api/lockup/the-graph/structure#batch-and-batcher)

To identify these relationships between stream items, the `Batch` entity will group items created in the same
transaction, by finding events emitted with the same tx hash. The `Batcher` will then assign a user-specific unique
index to every group.

---

## Watcher

The Watcher (one for the entire subgraph) will provide specific utilities to the entire system, like global stream
identifiers (a numeric id unique to a stream across all contract instances) and global action identifiers.
