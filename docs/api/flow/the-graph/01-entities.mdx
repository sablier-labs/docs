## Entity Architecture

GraphQL entities defined by the Sablier subgraphs are meant to mirror the functionality exposed by our core flow
contracts. To achieve this, events are stored as historical entries (e.g. Action) while also being used to mutate
attributes for live entities (e.g. Stream).

Inside the **flow** subgraph, the
[`schema.graphql`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/indexers/blob/main/apps/flow/schema.graphql) file is responsible of
defining the following Sablier entities:

### Primary

| Entity   | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract | Instances of `SablierFlow`                                                                  |
| Action   | Emitted events transformed into historical entries (e.g. Create, Withdraw, Adjust, Deposit) |
| Stream   | Primary entity tracking the up to date state of a stream                                    |
| Asset    | The ERC20 asset that is being streamed                                                      |

### Secondary

| Entity  | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch   | An entity grouping a set of stream created all at once (action done through the batch interface of SablierFlow contracts) |
| Batcher | An entity resolving 1:1 to a stream sender, in charge of managing the count of "batches" of streams one creates           |
| Watcher | A singleton data store for subgraph-level unique indexes such as the stream or action index                               |
