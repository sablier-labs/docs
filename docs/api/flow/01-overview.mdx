# Flow

Sablier's [flow](/concepts/flow/overview) streams are used for the [payments](/apps/features/payments) component of the
Sablier Interfaces.

For the flow-native functionality, these sides are powered by:

- The `@sablier/subgraphs/apps/flow` subgraph
- The `@sablier/subgraphs/apps/flow-envio` indexer
