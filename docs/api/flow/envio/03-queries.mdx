Building on top of the [entity structure](/api/flow/the-graph/structure) defined earlier, here are some common GraphQL
queries for fetching data from the Sablier subgraph.

### Recent streams

```graphql title="The 10 most recent streams"
query getStreams {
  Stream(limit: 10, distinct_on: [subgraphId], order_by: { subgraphId: desc }) {
    id
    alias
    category
    asset {
      id
      symbol
    }
  }
}
```

### Paginated streams

To query streams in sets/pages (and avoid edge cases where using timestamps may skip simultaneous batched streams), we
can use the unique `subgraphId`.

This query includes pagination.

```graphql title="The next streams indexed before the last seen subgraphId"
query getStreams($first: Int!, $subgraphId: numeric!) {
  Stream(
    limit: $first
    distinct_on: [subgraphId]
    order_by: { subgraphId: desc }
    where: { subgraphId: { _lt: $subgraphId } }
  ) {
    id
    alias
    category
    asset {
      id
      symbol
    }
  }
}
```

### Streams by sender

This query includes pagination.

:::warning

Some queries, especially those using `OR` will potentially yield duplicate results. To make sure we only retrieve unique
streams/entities with a query, we make use of the `distinct_on` filter (and apply it on keys included in `order_by`).

:::

```graphql title="The next streams created by an address"
Stream(
  limit: $first
  offset: $skip
  distinct_on: [subgraphId]
  order_by: { subgraphId: desc }
  where: {
    _and: [{ sender: {_eq: $sender} }, { subgraphId: {_lt: $subgraphId} }]
  }
) {
  id
  alias
  category
}
```

### Streams by sender or recipient

To show all streams that have an address marked as a sender (all cases) or a recipient, extend the example above to
account for the recipient aspect.

This query includes pagination.

```graphql title="The next streams related to an address, as a sender or recipient"
Stream(
  limit: $first
  offset: $skip
  distinct_on: [subgraphId]
  order_by: { subgraphId: desc }
  where: {
    or: [
      { _and: [{ sender: {_eq: $sender} }, { subgraphId: {_lt:  $subgraphId} }] }
      { _and: [{ recipient: {_eq: $recipient} }, { subgraphId: {_lt: $subgraphId} }] }
    ]
  }
) {
    id
    alias
    category
  }
```

### Streams by filters

The official V2 Interfaces will provide a search interface where one may query for a list of streams using the following
filters (the conditions will be combined)

- the sender address
- the recipient address
- a list of stream identifiers

This query includes pagination.

```graphql title="The 'where' clause for a complex paginated search filter"
where: {
    _or: [
      {
        _and: [
          { chainId: { _eq: $chainId } }
          { sender: { _eq: $sender } }
          { subgraphId: { _lt: $subgraphId } }
        ]
      }
      {
        _and: [
          { chainId: { _eq: $chainId } }
          { recipient: { _eq: $recipient } }
          { subgraphId: { _lt: $subgraphId } }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

### Actions by stream

:::tip

To avoid writing the same entity definitions over and over again, check out Fragments.

:::

```graphql title="Most recent 100 stream actions such as withdrawals or transfers"
Action(
  limit: 100
  distinct_on: [subgraphId]
  order_by: { subgraphId: desc }
  where: { stream_id: {_eq: $streamId} }
) {
  id
  category
  stream {
    ...StreamFragment
  }
}
```
