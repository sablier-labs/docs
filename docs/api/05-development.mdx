## The Graph

### Integrate

To integrate the Sablier subgraphs or indexers into your project, start from the official `@sablier/subgraphs`
repository.

<LinkPreview
  href="https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs"
  icon="github"
  subtitle="GitHub"
  title="Github - sablier-labs/subgraphs: Sablier Subgraphs"
/>

We recommend using:

- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started) to create types from your GraphQL
  fragments and queries.
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) to fetch results from the exposed endpoints.

### Contribute

To contribute to the subgraphs or deploy your own, head over to the GitHub
[`subgraphs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs) repository. Get started by reviewing the `apps/lockup`
directory.

To bootstrap a subgraph project, run the following commands. They will install the requisite dependencies and generate
the code for a Ethereum Sepolia deployment.

```bash
cd ./apps/lockup
yarn install
yarn setup:sepolia
```

To deploy a new subgraph on Ethereum Sepolia:

1. Create a new item using The Graph's hosted network
2. Add its name/endpoint under the `deploy:sepolia` script in `package.json`
3. Add your own Sablier contract addresses in `../constants/chains/sepolia.ts`
4. Make sure you're [authenticated][the-graph-auth] on your local machine
5. Run `yarn deploy:sepolia`

You can read more about how the The Graph works in their [official docs][the-graph-docs].

To publish on the hosted service:

1. [Authenticate](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/deploying/hosted-service/) with the hosted service credentials

   ```sh
   graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
   ```

2. Generate configuration

   Run `yarn deploy:<chain_name>` to generate imports, configurations and deploy in the same script.

## Envio

### Integrate

To integrate the Sablier indexers into your own product, start from the official `@sablier/subgraphs` repository. We
recommend using:

- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started) to create types from your GraphQL
  fragments and queries
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) to fetch results from the exposed endpoints.

If you're integrated the Sablier subgraphs, we recommend using request and response wrappers/middleware to format
results coming from Envio's indexer in the same shape as those from The Graph. Suggestions:

1. Write queries in both systems (based on the [querying language specifics](/api/caveats#querying-language)) using the
   same `operationName` and swap query strings between vendors based on it
2. Write response middleware that converts results into similar shapes (see these [important notes](/api/caveats))

### Test

To ensure Envio indexers deliver the same data as The Graph's subgraphs, we've written differential tests for our
indexer configurations.

Check them out inside the `apps/[...]/test/` folders.

<LinkPreview
  href="https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs"
  icon="github"
  subtitle="@sablier-labs/subgraphs"
  title="Github - sablier-labs/subgraphs: Sablier Subgraphs"
/>

#### Run

The differentials tests are powered by Jest. Inside `test/setup/constants.ts`, you will find the full configuration for
these tests. This is where you'll also be able to toggle between using the local endpoint (see
[development](/api/development) to bootstrap a project locally) and the hosted-service one, using the `REMOTE` flag.

```bash
pnpm run test
```

:::info

As the set of streams or campaigns grows, the final tests (full coverage over the entire list of elements) may time out.
We suggest either splitting them in chunks or setting a manual limit to the number of iterations the loop can cover at
once. Alternatively, you could also try increasing the timeout of the tests.

### Contribute

To contribute to the V2 indexers (Envio x Sablier) or deploy your own, head over to the GitHub
[`subgraphs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs) repository. Get started by reviewing the `apps/lockup-envio`
directory.

To bootstrap an indexer project, run the following commands. They will install the requisite dependencies and generate
the code for a multi-chain deployment.

```bash
cd ./apps/lockup-envio
pnpm install
pnpm run setup

# OR

pnpm dev
```

A local Hasura process will be started at `http://localhost:8080` ,which will also include a `GraphQL` endpoint to query
locally. To deploy without hosting yourself, have a look at the Envio
[Hosted Service](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hosted-service) docs.

:::info

Prior to starting the `Envio` process (`pnpm dev`) please make sure your Docker app is running. For installation see the
official docs at https://docs.envio.dev/.

## Sablier SDK: Merkle API

### Integrate

To integrate the Sablier Merkle API into your own product, start from the official `@sablier/merkle-api` repository. We
recommend using:

<LinkPreview
  href="https://github.com/sablier-labs/merkle-api"
  icon="github"
  subtitle="GitHub"
  title="Github - sablier-labs/merkle-api: Sablier Merkle API (Airstreams)"
/>

### Contribute

To contribute to the V2 Merkle API or deploy your own, head over to the GitHub
[`merkle-api`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/merkle-api) repository. Get started by reviewing the `controllers`
directory.

### Run an instance

#### Locally

In order to make the API work properly, you will need to create a `.env` file by following the `.env.example` file:

```text
PINATA_ACCESS_TOKEN=
PINATA_API_KEY=
PINATA_API_SERVER=
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
IPFS_GATEWAY=
```

After a campaign is created via the API, we use Pinata to upload and pin the file to IPFS. In order to obtain the
`PINATA_API_KEY`, `PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY` and `PINATA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, follow these steps:

1. Sign up or log in on https://app.pinata.cloud/
1. Select the API Keys tab
1. Select New Key
1. The key should have the permissions `pinFileToIPFS` and `pinJSONToIPFS`
1. Set a name for the key
1. Click Create Key
1. From the popup, take the API Key and the API Secret and put them in the `.env` file. The `IPFS_GATEWAY` variable can
   be any IPFS gateway but we recommend using a private one (Pinata offers this as well). For more details about the
   interactions with IPFS, check
   [`src/services/ipfs.rs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/merkle-api/blob/main/src/services/ipfs.rs).
1. Select the "Access Controls" tab
1. Click on the "Request Token" button
1. Copy the token and put in th `.env` file in the `PINATA_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable

Simulate the cloud environment by finally running:

```sh
cargo run --bin sablier_merkle_api
```

This command will run a standard web API and expose it on port 3000 on localhost.

### Vercel

We use Vercel for hosting, and this is why we have separate binaries for each endpoint. For local development, use this
command:

```sh
vercel dev
```

This command will run a standard web API and expose it on port 3000 on localhost.

If you wish to deploy your backend to vercel, check the official
[Github Actions](https://github.com/sablier-labs/merkle-api/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-merkle-api.yml) workflow
for deploying. Rust is supported through Vercel's [`rust runtime`](https://github.com/vercel-community/rust).
