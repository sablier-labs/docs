In order to start indexing all whitelisted Lockup contracts we need a genesis event. With Sablier V2, there is no
factory pattern so we couldn't rely on a
[data source](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#data-source-templates) contract. The next
best things for a "genesis" point were:

1. Relying on the [Comptroller](/contracts/v2/reference/core/contract.SablierV2Comptroller) whitelisting the first
   contract
2. Relying on the first event triggered by the earliest registered on-chain contract

To reduce the number of dependencies required to kickstart a subgraph, we chose to rely on the second approach.
Therefore, when setting up a deployment, you'll need to follow a few
[rules](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs/blob/main/packages/core/src/constants/chains/goerli.ts).

```ts title="core/src/constants/chains/goerli.ts"
export let chainId = 5;
export let chain = "goerli";
export let startBlock = 9283515;

/**
 * Keep aliases unique and always in sync with the frontend
 * Keep addresses unique and lowercased
 * @example export let linear = [[address1, alias2], [address2, alias2]]
 */

export let linear: string[][] = [["0x6e3678c005815ab34986d8d66a353cd3699103de", "LL"]];

export let dynamic: string[][] = [["0x4be70ede968e9dba12db42b9869bec66bedc17d7", "LD"]];

/** PRBProxy registry */
export let registry = "0xd42a2bb59775694c9df4c7822bffab150e6c699d";

// highlight-start
/**
 * The initializer contract is used to trigger the indexing of all other contracts.
 * It should be a linear contract, the oldest/first one deployed on this chain.
 */

export let initializer = linear[0][0];
//highlight-end
```
