## Architecture

GraphQL entities defined by the Sablier subgraphs are meant to mirror the functionality exposed by the v2-core
contracts. To achieve this, events are stored as historical entries (e.g. Action) while also being used to mutate
attributes for live entities (e.g. Stream). Some external utilities may also be used by this subgraph to improve the
developer experience (e.g. tracking the immutable PRBProxy or a stream creator).

Inside the **core** subgraph, the
[`schema.graphql`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs/blob/main/packages/core/schema.graphql) file is
responsible of defining the following Sablier entities:

### Primary

| Entity   | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contract | Instances of `SablierV2LockupLinear` or `SablierV2LockupDynamic`                           |
| Action   | Emitted events transformed into historical entries (e.g. Create, Withdraw)                 |
| Stream   | Primary entity tracking the up to date state of a stream                                   |
| Asset    | The ERC20 asset that is being streamed                                                     |
| Segment  | The function segment used to build the custom curve in cases of LockupDynamic streams care |

### Secondary

| Entity  | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch   | An entity grouping a set of stream created all at once (action done through the `v2-periphery`)                 |
| Batcher | An entity resolving 1:1 to a stream sender, in charge of managing the count of "batches" of streams one creates |
| Watcher | A singleton data store for subgraph-level unique indexes such as the stream or action index                     |
