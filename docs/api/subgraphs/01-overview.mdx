# The Sablier Subgraphs

Sablier uses multiple [subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) for indexing and
organizing data from the Sablier smart contracts. These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph Network, as well as on the The
Graph Hosted Service. They can be used to query Sablier data.

## Architecture

To study the architecture of the subgraphs and learn about their design, have a look at the high level
[Entities](/api/subgraphs/architecture/entities) and their [Structural](/api/subgraphs/architecture/structure) details.

## Endpoints

To start using the subgraphs in your own applications check out the [Endpoints](/api/subgraphs/endpoints).

## Queries

To get started integrating the subgraph into your own applications you can extend some of the
[example](/api/subgraphs/queries) queries. These will also showcase the filtering logic used by our own V2 apps.

## Development

To contribute, learn or suggest improvements to the subgraphs, check out the official
[`v2-subgraphs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs) github repository.
