# Drops

Sablier's [Lockup](/concepts/lockup/overview) streams are used for the [Vesting](/apps/features/vesting) and (part of)
the [Drops](/apps/features/drops) components of the Sablier Interfaces. The Drops section, supported by our
[Merkle](/concepts/lockup/airstreams) utilities focuses on the functionality of the Merkle Factory peripheries.

Drops-native functionality is powered by:

- The `@sablier/subgraphs/apps/merkle` subgraph
- The `@sablier/subgraphs/apps/merkle-envio` indexer
- The `@sablier/merkle-api` sdk

For the Lockup-native functionality, please check the dedicated [documentation](/api/lockup/overview).

:::tip

[Airstreamed](/apps/features/drops) drops, will reward users a lockup stream once a claim is made.

## What are Drops / Airstreams?

**Drops** are large-scale campaigns developed to aid with token distribution towards millions of users. They rely on
**merkle trees** to efficiently store eligibility details.

Extending the classic instant airdrop, Sablier engineered Airstreams, a way to reward users with streams which vest
rewards over time, instead of unlocking a lump-sum of assets.

The first step before diving into this guide is to become familiar with the [concepts](/concepts/lockup/airstreams).

#### Naming convention

As per our endpoint [naming convention](api/overview#endpoints--slugs), subgraph deployments of Sablier Airstreams and
Instant Drops will follow the `sablier-v2-ms-*` (short for "merkle subgraph") structure (e.g. `sablier-v2-ms` for
Mainnet, `sablier-v2-ms-base` for Base).
