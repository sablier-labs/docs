# Examples of common flows

Here are some common architectural flows you may need to integrate into your application. These include ways to gather
the prerequisite data necessary for each backend [functionality](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/functionality) described
earlier.

## Get a campaign's CID

To get a hold of a campaign's IPFS CID, you can:

<ol type="A">
  <li>
    Check the [create](/reference/airdrops/contracts/interfaces/interface.ISablierMerkleFactory#events) events emitted
    by the Merkle factory
  </li>
  <li>Use the Sablier [subgraphs / indexers](/api/overview) to query for that particular piece of information.</li>
</ol>

For approach "B", run the following query against the official endpoints:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="TheGraph" label="The Graph" default>
 ```GraphQL title:Example of a query for campaign data using The Graph's subgraphs
    query getCampaignData($campaignId: String!){
      campaign(id: $campaignId){
        id
        lockup
        root
        //highlight-start
        ipfsCID
        //highlight-end
        aggregateAmount
        totalRecipients
      }
    }
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Envio" label="Envio">
 ```GraphQL title:Example of a query for campaign data using Envio's indexers
    query getCampaignData($campaignId: String!){
      Campaign(where: {id: {_eq: $campaignId}} ){
        id
        lockup
        root
        //highlight-start
        ipfsCID
        //highlight-end
        aggregateAmount
        totalRecipients
      }
    }
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Check eligibility for an address

To check if an address is eligible, you'll have to use the [/api/eligibility](functionality#eligibility-apieligibility)
route provided by the merkle-api backend.

#### Steps

1. Get the campaign CID (see [the example](examples#get-a-campaigns-cid) above)
2. Call the`/api/eligibility` route using the CID and the wallet address

Please read more on the dedicated route documentation within the
[/api/eligibility](functionality#eligibility-apieligibility) section of the functionality page.

As an alternative, you can also check the eligibility of an address (and bypass the backend) by simply searching for
that address in the list stored within the IPFS file from step 1. You'll still have to download the file first, using
its CID.

## Get the tokenId after a claim

After someone claims, you may want to show them a preview of the stream (or its NFT). To do that, you'll have to get a
hold of the `tokenId` (or `streamId`) related to that user's claim.

To get a hold of a `tokenId` linked to a claim you can:

<ol type="A">
  <li>
    Listen to the [claim](/reference/airdrops/contracts/interfaces/interface.ISablierMerkleLL#claim) method and the
    Claim event emitted by the Merkle contract instance
  </li>
  <li>Use the Sablier [subgraphs / indexers](/api/overview) to query for that particular piece of information.</li>
</ol>

For approach "B", run the following query against the official endpoints (make sure the address is lowercased):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="TheGraph" label="The Graph" default>
 ```GraphQL title:Example of a query for claim data using The Graph's subgraphs
    query getClaimForRecipient($campaignId: String!, $recipient: String){
      actions(where: {campaign: $campaignId, category: Claim, claimRecipient: $recipient }){
        campaign{
          id
          lockup
        }
        claimTokenId
        claimRecipient
        claimIndex
      }
    }
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Envio" label="Envio">
 ```GraphQL title:Example of a query for claim data using Envio's indexers
      query getClaimForRecipient($campaignId: String!, $recipient: String){
      Action(where: {
        _and: [
          {campaign: {_eq: $campaignId}}
          {category: {_eq: Claim}}
          {claimRecipient: {_eq: $recipient}}
        ]
      }){
        campaignObject{
          id
          lockup
        }
        claimTokenId
        claimRecipient
        claimIndex
      }
    }
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Bonus: Stream NFT

To get the Stream NFT, using the same query as in option "B", retrieve the `lockup` contract (where the Stream NFT is
issued) and its `tokenId`. With them you can call the
[`tokenURI`](/reference/lockup/contracts/contract.LockupNFTDescriptor#tokenuri) method, which will return the SVG code
of the onchain NFT.

:::note Extract the SVG tags

The actual SVG tags are encoded inside the response of the `tokenURI` method. You can feed this blob to an HTML `img`
tag or choose to render the SVG tags themselves. To get a hold of this code in plain format (not in `base64`) you could
run the following Javascript code which decodes the response and

```typescript
const toPart = output.split("data:application/json;base64,").pop();
const toString = Buffer.from(toPart || "", "base64").toString("utf-8");
const toJSON = JSON.parse(toString);

const blob = _.get(toJSON, "image")?.split("data:image/svg+xml;base64,")[1];
const toSVG = Buffer.from(blob || "", "base64").toString("utf-8");
```

## Check if a user claimed their stream

To check if a user has already claimed their stream from a campaign you can:

<ol type="A">
  <li>
    Call the [hasClaimed](/reference/airdrops/contracts/interfaces/interface.ISablierMerkleBase#hasclaimed) method form
    the Merkle contract instance
  </li>
  <li>Use the Sablier [subgraphs / indexers](/api/overview) to query for that particular piece of information.</li>
</ol>

#### Approach A

For approach "A" you'll need to perform the following actions:

1. Get a hold of the campaign's CID, Lockup contract address, and user address (for the first items, see the
   [Get a campaign's CID](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/examples#get-a-campaigns-cid) example above)
2. Check the eligibility of a user (see
   [Eligibility](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/examples#check-eligibility-for-an-address) example above) and extract their
   `index`
3. Call the `hasClaimed` method inside the `lockup` contract using the `index` retrieved at step 2

:::note

The index of a particular user represents their assigned order number in the eligibility list. We use this value to
generate a proof in case the recipient is eligible and to register their claim directly inside the contract.

:::

#### Approach B

For approach "B", run the same query as in the
[Get the tokenId after a claim](/api/airdrops/merkle-api/examples#get-the-tokenid-after-a-claim) example. If the query
yields any results, that means the user has claimed their stream.

:::tip

A missing claim could also mean the user wasn't eligible in the first place. We recommend checking for eligibility
alongside any existing claim checks.
