Sablier Airdrops use pre-configured Merkle trees, a data structure that efficiently stores recipient lists and their
individual claim details.

## General data flow

Merkle trees enable minimal onchain storage while maintaining cryptographic proof of eligibility. The system stores only
the tree's root hash in the deployed Airstream contract, while the complete tree and recipient list reside in IPFS.

Operations like eligibility checks or claim detail requests follow this process:

1. Read data from the IPFS file
2. Generate Merkle proofs from the tree
3. Interact with the contract using the obtained data

## Open-source solution

We've built a Rust backend service that provides REST API access to Merkle tree functionality. This service handles tree
creation, storage, and data retrieval for both the Sablier Interface and third-party applications.

## Integrations

Integrate this API by forking the repository to run your own instance. We actively improve and optimize this service, so
submit suggestions or issues directly on GitHub.

:::tip If you want to integrate the eligibility/claim functionality in your, you have the following options:

1. Self Host the above api
2. Reach out for a more powerful backend we can host for you
3. Reach out for a custom script to pre-generate proofs and save them wherever it suits you :::
