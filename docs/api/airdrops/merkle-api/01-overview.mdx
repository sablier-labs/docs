Sablier's Airdrops rely on pre-configured Merkle trees. This data structure contains the list of recipients as well as
their individual claim details.

### General data flow

Trees allow us to store minimal data at the contract level, while being able to cryptographically prove someone is
entitled to claim from the contract, using proofs generated with a separate off-chain dataset (and the onchain root).

The root hash of the tree will be stored inside the deployed Airstream contract. The tree itself, as well as the initial
list will be stored in an IPFS file.

Any action such as checking for eligibility or requesting the claim details of a certain user will involve reading from
the IPFS file, generating proofs based on the Merkle tree and interacting with the contract using the data obtained
previously.

### Open-source solution

To make this functionality available to both Sablier client interfaces and 3rd party integrators we've created a Rust
backend service called `merkle-api`. Through a REST API, it provides access to creating, storing and reading from
Airstream related Merkle trees.

#### Integrations

To integrate this API into your own applications, feel free to use the official endpoints or fork the repository and run
the backend in your own environment. We're keen to improve and optimize this service, so any suggestions or issues can
be flagged directly in the Github repository.
