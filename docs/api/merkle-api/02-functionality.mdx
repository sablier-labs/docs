## Architecture

The backend is written in Rust. It can run locally (or in a self-hosted environment) with
[`warp`](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) as well as using Vercel with its
[`rust runtime`](https://github.com/vercel-community/rust).

You can integrate the backend functionality using the official endpoints (below) but we recommend running it in a
self-hosted environment for improved reliability (meaning you can fork and provide your own IPFS and Pinata access
keys).

Feel free to reach out for any guidance or feedback.

## Create: `/api/create`

Call this route to create a new Merkle/Airstream campaign.

### Prerequisites

Before creating a new campaign, you'll need:

- The `decimals` of the asset you're basing the campaign upon
- A CSV file including a list of `[address, amount]` for every campaign recipient

You can download a template for the CSV file from the link below or preview it
[here](https://github.com/sablier-labs/sablier-labs.github.io/blob/1933e3b5176c93b236d9a483683dad3a282cc39a/templates/airstream-template.csv).

  title="Sablier Template for Airstreams (CSV)"
/>

:::tip

The CSV will contain a header row, followed by pairs of addresses and amounts. The amounts will be in humanized form, as
the API deals with the padding of each value (with the decimals of the token) on its own.

| **Response**     | See in [Rust](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-merkle-api/blob/main/src/data_objects/response.rs#L22) Overview TS (below) |

```typescript
type Response = {
  /** IPFS content identifier for the uploaded file */
  cid: string;
  /** Expected number of recipients */
  recipients: string;
  /** HEX root fo the merkle tree */
  root: string;
  /** Humanized status */
  status: string;
  /** Expected amount of assets required by the campaign */
  total: string;
};
```

### Functionality

The `/api/create` route will perform the following actions:

**1. Validation and processing**

- Validate the CSV file and its contents
- Add decimal padding to every amount
- Build the Merkle tree and generate a root hash
- Compute intermediary data (e.g. total expected amount, number of recipients)
- Prepare an object containing the list, the tree and the data above

**2. Upload to IPFS**

- Upload the object in a JSON file on IPFS
- Get a hold of the IPFS CID (unique identifier of the uploaded file)

**3. Return data to client**

- Return the root hash, IPFS CID and intermediary data points to the client
- [Next] The client will use all these to call the factory and deploy a new campaign

## Eligibility: `/api/eligibility`

Call this route to check if a recipient is eligible to claim a stream from the Merkle/Airstream campaign.

:::info

This endpoint uses an authentication scheme. Please reach out if you need to use our deployed endpoints in your app.

:::

### Prerequisites

To check eligibility for an address, you'll be required to provide:

- the address of the user
- the CID of the IPFS file (see the [create](/api/merkle-api/functionality#create-apicreate) flow above for context) the
  campaign is linked to

To get a hold of the second item you can see some options here in the
[Common flows](/api/merkle-api/examples#get-a-campaigns-cid) page.

  /** Amount the recipient is eligible for */
  amount: string;
  /** Position of the recipient in the list */
  index: 0;
  /** Merkle proof */
  proof: string[];
};
```

### Functionality

The `/api/eligibility` route will perform the following actions:

1. Retrieve the campaign's IPFS file and extract the recipient's list and merkle tree
2. Search for the provided wallet address

## Eligibility: `/api/validity`

Call this route to check if an IPFS CID links to a valid Merkle/Airstream campaign file. Given users may create
campaigns by passing invalid IPFS CIDs (by mistake), we use this route to perform some minor sanity checks before
allowing admins to pursue the creation of a campaign in the UI.

### Prerequisites

To check eligibility for an address, you'll be required to provide:

- the CID of the IPFS file the campaign is linked to

To get a hold of it you can see some options here in the [Common flows](/api/merkle-api/examples#get-a-campaigns-cid)
page.
