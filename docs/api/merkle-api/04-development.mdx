## Integrating

To integrate the Sablier V2 Merkle API into your own product, start from the official `@sablier/v2-merkle-api`
repository. We recommend using:

<LinkPreview
  href="https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-merkle-api"
  icon="github"
  subtitle="GitHub"
  title="Github - sablier-labs/v2-merkle-api: Sablier V2 Merkle API (Airstreams)"
/>

## Contributing

To contribute to the V2 Merkle API or deploy your own, head over to the GitHub
[`v2-merkle-api`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-merkle-api) repository. Get started by reviewing the `controllers`
directory.

## Running an instance

### Locally

In order to make the API work properly, you will need to create a `.env` file by following the `.env.example` file:

```text
PINATA_ACCESS_TOKEN=
PINATA_API_KEY=
PINATA_API_SERVER=
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
IPFS_GATEWAY=
```

After a campaign is created via the API, we use Pinata to upload and pin the file to IPFS. In order to obtain the
`PINATA_API_KEY`, `PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY` and `PINATA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, follow these steps:

1. Sign up or log in on https://app.pinata.cloud/
1. Select the API Keys tab
1. Select New Key
1. The key should have the permissions `pinFileToIPFS` and `pinJSONToIPFS`
1. Set a name for the key
1. Click Create Key
1. From the popup, take the API Key and the API Secret and put them in the `.env` file. The `IPFS_GATEWAY` variable can
   be any IPFS gateway but we recommend using a private one (Pinata offers this as well). For more details about the
   interactions with IPFS, check
   [`src/services/ipfs.rs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-merkle-api/blob/main/src/services/ipfs.rs).
1. Select the "Access Controls" tab
1. Click on the "Request Token" button
1. Copy the token and put in th `.env` file in the `PINATA_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable

Simulate the cloud environment by finally running:

```sh
$ cargo run --bin sablier_merkle_api
```

This command will run a standard web API and expose it on port 3000 on localhost.

### Vercel

We use Vercel for hosting, and this is why we have separate binaries for each endpoint. For local development, use this
command:

```sh
$ vercel dev
```

This command will run a standard web API and expose it on port 3000 on localhost.

If you wish to deploy your backend to vercel, check the official
[Github Actions](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-merkle-api/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-merkle-api.yml)
workflow for deploying. Rust is supported through Vercel's [`rust runtime`](https://github.com/vercel-community/rust).
